	abstract = {Phylogenetic trees define a metric space over their vertices, an observation that underlines distance-based phylogenetic inference. Several authors, including Layer and Rhodes (2017), have noted that we can embed leaves of a phylogenetic tree into high-dimensional Euclidean spaces in such a way that it minimizes the distortion of the tree distances. Jiang et al. (2021) use a deep learning approach to build a mapping from the space of sequences to the Euclidean space such that the mapped sequences accurately preserve the leaf distances on a given tree. Their tool, DEPP, uses this map to place a new query sequence onto the tree by first embedding it, an idea that was particularly promising for updating a species tree given data from a single gene despite the potential discordance of the gene tree and the species tree. In focusing on Euclidean spaces, these recent papers have ignored the strong theory that suggests hyperbolic spaces are more appropriate for embedding vertices of a tree. In this paper, we show that by moving to hyperbolic spaces and addressing challenges related to non-linearity and precision, we can reduce the distortion of distances for any given number of dimensions. The distortion of distances obtained using hyperbolic embeddings is lower than Euclidean embeddings with the same number of dimensions, both in training (backbone) and testing (query). The low-distortion distances of embeddings result in better topological accuracy in updating species trees using a single gene compared to its Euclidean counterpart. It also improves accuracy in placing queries for some datasets but not all.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic placement, used widely in ecological analyses, seeks to add a new species to an existing tree. A deep learning approach was previously proposed to estimate the distance between query and backbone species by building a map from gene sequences to a high-dimensional space that preserves species tree distances. They then use a distance-based placement method to place the queries on that species tree. In this paper, we examine the appropriate geometry for faithfully representing tree distances while embedding gene sequences. Theory predicts that hyperbolic spaces should provide a drastic reduction in distance distortion compared to the conventional Euclidean space. Nevertheless, hyperbolic embedding imposes its own unique challenges related to arithmetic operations, exponentially-growing functions, and limited bit precision, and we address these challenges. Our results confirm that hyperbolic embeddings have substantially lower distance errors than Euclidean space. However, these better-estimated distances do not always lead to better phylogenetic placement. We then show that the deep learning framework can be used not just to place on a backbone tree but to update it to obtain a fully resolved tree. With our hyperbolic embedding framework, species trees can be updated remarkably accurately with only a handful of genes.},

	abstract = {The abundant discordance between evolutionary relationships across the genome has rekindled interest in ways of comparing and averaging trees on a shared leaf set. However, most attempts at reconciling trees have focused on tree topology, producing metrics for comparing topologies and methods for computing median tree topologies. Using branch lengths, however, has been more elusive, due to several challenges. Species tree branch lengths can be measured in many units, often different from gene trees. Moreover, rates of evolution change across the genome, the species tree, and specific branches of gene trees. These factors compound the stochasticity of coalescence times. Thus, branch lengths are highly heterogeneous across both the genome and the tree. For many downstream applications in phylogenomic analyses, branch lengths are as important as the topology, and yet, existing tools to compare and combine weighted trees are limited. In this paper, we make progress on the question of mapping one tree to another, incorporating both topology and branch length. We define a series of computational problems to formalize finding the best transformation of one tree to another while maintaining its topology and other constraints. We show that all these problems can be solved in quadratic time and memory using a linear algebraic formulation coupled with dynamic programming preprocessing. Our formulations lead to convex optimization problems, with efficient and theoretically optimal solutions. While many applications can be imagined for this framework, we apply it to measure species tree branch lengths in the unit of the expected number of substitutions per site while allowing divergence from ultrametricity across the tree. In these applications, our method matches or surpasses other methods designed directly for solving those problems. Thus, our approach provides a versatile toolkit that finds applications in similar evolutionary questions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

            Inferring a phylogenetic tree is a fundamental challenge in evolutionary studies. Current paradigms for phylogenetic tree reconstruction rely on performing costly likelihood optimizations. With the aim of making tree inference feasible for problems involving more than a handful of sequences, inference under the maximum-likelihood paradigm integrates heuristic approaches to evaluate only a subset of all potential trees. Consequently, existing methods suffer from the known tradeoff between accuracy and running time. In this proof-of-concept study, we train a machine-learning algorithm over an extensive cohort of empirical data to predict the neighboring trees that increase the likelihood, without actually computing their likelihood. This provides means to safely discard a large set of the search space, thus potentially accelerating heuristic tree searches without losing accuracy. Our analyses suggest that machine learning can guide tree-search methodologies towards the most promising candidate trees.},

	abstract = {Metagenomics is widely used to study the microbiome using environmental samples, and taxonomic classification of reads is a precursor to many analyses of such data. Taxonomic classification requires comparing sample reads against a reference dataset of known organisms. Crucially, the genomes represented in a sample may be phylogenetically distant from their closest match in the reference set. Thus, simply mapping reads to genomes is insufficient; we need to find inexact matches to species with substantial distance. While k-mer-based methods, such as Kraken, have proved popular, they have limited ability to match against distant taxa. In this paper, we use locality sensitive hashing to design a k-mer-based method that can match reads to genomes with higher distance than existing methods. We build on an earlier contamination detection method, CONSULT, to add taxonomic classification abilities. We show in a series of experiments that our method, CONSULT-II, has higher recall than alternatives when precision is about the same. Its results can also be summarized to obtain a taxonomic profile, which we show outperforms leading methods with respect to some measurement criteria.

With the advent of ChIP-seq technology, experimental detection of genome-wide EP300/CREBBP bound regions provides a powerful platform to develop predictive tools for regulatory sequences and to study their sequence properties. Here, we develop a support vector machine (SVM) framework which can accurately identify EP300-bound enhancers using only genomic sequence and an unbiased set of general sequence features. Moreover, we find that the predictive sequence features identified by the SVM classifier reveal biologically relevant sequence elements enriched in the enhancers, but we also identify other features that are significantly depleted in enhancers. The predictive sequence features are evolutionarily conserved and spatially clustered, providing further support of their functional significance. Although our SVM is trained on experimental data, we also predict novel enhancers and show that these putative enhancers are significantly enriched in both ChIP-seq signal and DNase I hypersensitivity signal in the mouse brain and are located near relevant genes. Finally, we present results of comparisons between other EP300/CREBBP data sets using our SVM and uncover sequence elements enriched and/or depleted in the different classes of enhancers. Many of these sequence features play a role in specifying tissue-specific or developmental-stage-specific enhancer activity, but our results indicate that some features operate in a general or tissue-independent manner. In addition to providing a high confidence list of enhancer targets for subsequent experimental investigation, these results contribute to our understanding of the general sequence structure of vertebrate enhancers.},

            Assessing effects of gene tree error in coalescent analyses have widely ignored coalescent branch lengths (CBLs) despite their potential utility in estimating ancestral population demographics and detecting species tree anomaly zones. However, the ability of coalescent methods to obtain accurate estimates remains largely unexplored. Errors in gene trees should lead to underestimates of the true CBL, and for a given set of comparisons, longer CBLs should be more accurate. Here, we furthered our empirical understanding of how error in gene tree quality (i.e., locus informativeness and gene tree resolution) affect CBLs using four datasets comprised of ultraconserved elements (UCE) or exons for clades that exhibit wide ranges of branch lengths. For each dataset, we compared the impact of locus informativeness (assessed using number of parsimony‐informative sites) and gene tree resolution on CBL estimates. Our results, in general, showed that CBLs were drastically shorter when estimates included low informative loci. Gene tree resolution also had an impact on UCE datasets, with polytomous gene trees producing longer branches than randomly resolved gene trees. However, resolution did not appear to affect CBL estimates from the more informative exon datasets. Thus, as expected, gene tree quality affects CBL estimates, though this can generally be minimized by using moderate filtering to select more informative loci and/or by allowing polytomies in gene trees. These approaches, as well as additional contributions to improve CBL estimation, should lead to CBLs that are useful for addressing evolutionary and biological questions.},

            A simple graphical device, the simplex plot of quartet concordance factors, is introduced to aid in the exploration of a collection of gene trees on a common set of taxa. A single plot summarizes all gene tree discord and allows for visual comparison to the expected discord from the multispecies coalescent model (MSC) of incomplete lineage sorting on a species tree. A formal statistical procedure is described that can quantify the deviation from expectation for each subset of four taxa, suggesting when the data are not in accord with the MSC, and thus that either gene tree inference error is substantial or a more complex model such as that on a network may be required. If the collection of gene trees is in accord with the MSC, the plots reveal when substantial incomplete lineage sorting is present. Applications to both simulated and empirical multilocus data sets illustrate the insights provided.

The accuracy of such analyses depends on the density of the backbone tree, making it crucial that placement methods scale to very large trees. Moreover, a new paradigm has been recently proposed to place sequences on the species tree using single-gene data. The goal is to better characterize the samples and to enable combined analyses of marker-gene (e.g., 16S rRNA gene amplicon) and genome-wide data. The recent method DEPP enables performing such analyses using metric learning. However, metric learning is hampered by a need to compute and save a quadratically growing matrix of pairwise distances during training. Thus, DEPP (or any distance-based method) does not scale to more than roughly ten thousand species, a problem that we faced when trying to use our recently released Greengenes2 (GG2) reference tree containing 331,270 species. Scalability problems can be addressed in phylogenetics using divide-and-conquer. However, applying divide-and-conquer to data-hungry machine learning methods needs nuance. This paper explores divide-and-conquer for training ensembles of DEPP models, culminating in a method called C-DEPP that uses carefully crafted techniques to enable quasi-linear scaling while maintaining accuracy. C-DEPP enables placing twenty million 16S fragments on the GG2 reference tree in 41 hours of computation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

              Background
              
                We consider two fundamental computational problems that arise when comparing phylogenetic trees, rooted or unrooted, with non-identical leaf sets. The first problem arises when comparing two trees where the leaf set of one tree is a proper subset of the other. The second problem arises when the two trees to be compared have only partially overlapping leaf sets. The traditional approach to handling these problems is to first restrict the two trees to their common leaf set. An alternative approach that has shown promise is to first
                complete
                the trees by adding missing leaves, so that the resulting trees have identical leaf sets. This requires the computation of an optimal completion that minimizes the distance between the two resulting trees over all possible completions.
              
            
            
              Results
              We provide optimal linear-time algorithms for both completion problems under the widely-used Robinson–Foulds (RF) distance measure. Our algorithm for the first problem improves the time complexity of the current fastest algorithm from quadratic (in the size of the two trees) to linear. No algorithms have yet been proposed for the more general second problem where both trees have missing leaves. We advance the study of this general problem by proposing a useful restricted version of the general problem and providing optimal linear-time algorithms for the restricted version. Our experimental results on biological data sets suggest that completion-based RF distances can be very different compared to traditional RF distances.},

              Adaptive genetic variation has been thought to originate primarily from either new mutation or standing variation. Another potential source of adaptive variation is adaptive variants from other (donor) species that are introgressed into the (recipient) species, termed adaptive introgression. Here, the various attributes of these three potential sources of adaptive variation are compared. For example, the rate of adaptive change is generally thought to be faster from standing variation, slower from mutation and potentially intermediate from adaptive introgression. Additionally, the higher initial frequency of adaptive variation from standing variation and lower initial frequency from mutation might result in a higher probability of fixation of the adaptive variants for standing variation. Adaptive variation from introgression might have higher initial frequency than new adaptive mutations but lower than that from standing variation, again making the impact of adaptive introgression variation potentially intermediate. Adaptive introgressive variants might have multiple changes within a gene and affect multiple loci, an advantage also potentially found for adaptive standing variation but not for new adaptive mutants. The processes that might produce a common variant in two taxa, convergence, trans‐species polymorphism from incomplete lineage sorting or from balancing selection and adaptive introgression, are also compared.

              The hundreds of cichlid fish species in Lake Malawi constitute the most extensive recent vertebrate adaptive radiation. Here we characterize its genomic diversity by sequencing 134 individuals covering 73 species across all major lineages. The average sequence divergence between species pairs is only 0.1–0.25\%. These divergence values overlap diversity within species, with 82\% of heterozygosity shared between species. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that diversification initially proceeded by serial branching from a generalist
              Astatotilapia
              -like ancestor. However, no single species tree adequately represents all species relationships, with evidence for substantial gene flow at multiple times. Common signatures of selection on visual and oxygen transport genes shared by distantly related deep-water species point to both adaptive introgression and independent selection. These findings enhance our understanding of genomic processes underlying rapid species diversification, and provide a platform for future genetic analysis of the Malawi radiation.},

              Taeniopygia guttata
              ) to develop a genetic linkage map, and then we used these map data together with the recently available draft genome sequence of the zebra finch to estimate recombination rates in 1 Mb intervals across the genome. The average zebra finch recombination rate (1.5 cM/Mb) is higher than in humans, but significantly lower than in chicken. The local rates of recombination in chicken and zebra finch were only weakly correlated, demonstrating evolutionary turnover of the recombination landscape in birds. The distribution of recombination events was heavily biased toward ends of chromosomes, with a stronger telomere effect than so far seen in any organism. In fact, the recombination rate was as low as 0.1 cM/Mb in intervals up to 100 Mb long in the middle of the larger chromosomes. We found a positive correlation between recombination rate and GC content, as well as GC-rich sequence motifs. Levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) were significantly higher in regions of low recombination, showing that heterogeneity in recombination rates have left a footprint on the genomic landscape of LD in zebra finch populations.},

            Current phylogenomic approaches implicitly assume that the predominant phylogenetic signal within a genome reflects the true evolutionary history of organisms, without assessing the confounding effects of postspeciation gene flow that can produce a mosaic of phylogenetic signals that interact with recombinational variation. Here, we tested the validity of this assumption with a phylogenomic analysis of 27 species of the cat family, assessing local effects of recombination rate on species tree inference and divergence time estimation across their genomes. We found that the prevailing phylogenetic signal within the autosomes is not always representative of the most probable speciation history, due to ancient hybridization throughout felid evolution. Instead, phylogenetic signal was concentrated within regions of low recombination, and notably enriched within large X chromosome recombination cold spots that exhibited recurrent patterns of strong genetic differentiation and selective sweeps across mammalian orders. By contrast, regions of high recombination were enriched for signatures of ancient gene flow, and these sequences inflated crown-lineage divergence times by ∼40\%. We conclude that existing phylogenomic approaches to infer the Tree of Life may be highly misleading without considering the genomic architecture of phylogenetic signal relative to recombination rate and its interplay with historical hybridization.},

	abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is a workhorse of modern data science. Practitioners typically perform PCA assuming the data conforms to Euclidean geometry. However, for specific data types, such as hierarchical data, other geometrical spaces may be more appropriate. We study PCA in space forms; that is, those with constant positive (spherical) and negative (hyperbolic) curvatures, in addition to zero-curvature (Euclidean) spaces. At any point on a Riemannian manifold, one can define a Riemannian affine subspace based on a set of tangent vectors and use invertible maps to project tangent vectors to the manifold and vice versa. Finding a low-dimensional Riemannian affine subspace for a set of points in a space form amounts to dimensionality reduction because, as we show, any such affine subspace is isometric to a space form of the same dimension and curvature. To find principal components, we seek a (Riemannian) affine subspace that best represents a set of manifold-valued data points with the minimum average cost of projecting data points onto the affine subspace. We propose specific cost functions that bring about two major benefits: (1) the affine subspace can be estimated by solving an eigenequation -- similar to that of Euclidean PCA, and (2) optimal affine subspaces of different dimensions form a nested set. These properties provide advances over existing methods which are mostly iterative algorithms with slow convergence and weaker theoretical guarantees. Specifically for hyperbolic PCA, the associated eigenequation operates in the Lorentzian space, endowed with an indefinite inner product; we thus establish a connection between Lorentzian and Euclidean eigenequations. We evaluate the proposed space form PCA on data sets simulated in spherical and hyperbolic spaces and show that it outperforms alternative methods in convergence speed or accuracy, often both.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Dating phylogenetic trees to obtain branch lengths in the unit of time is essential for many downstream applications but has remained challenging. Dating requires inferring mutation rates that can change across the tree. While we can assume to have information about a small subset of nodes from the fossil record or sampling times (for fast-evolving organisms), inferring the ages of the other nodes essentially requires extrapolation and interpolation. Assuming a clock model that defines a distribution over rates, we can formulate dating as a constrained maximum likelihood (ML) estimation problem. While ML dating methods exist, their accuracy degrades in the face of model misspecification where the assumed parametric statistical clock model vastly differs from the true distribution. Notably, existing methods tend to assume rigid, often unimodal rate distributions. A second challenge is that the likelihood function involves an integral over the continuous domain of the rates and often leads to difficult non-convex optimization problems. To tackle these two challenges, we propose a new method called Molecular Dating using Categorical-models (MD-Cat). MD-Cat uses a categorical model of rates inspired by non-parametric statistics and can approximate a large family of models by discretizing the rate distribution into k categories. Under this model, we can use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to co-estimate rate categories and branch lengths in the time unit. Our model has fewer assumptions about the true clock model than parametric models such as Gamma or LogNormal distribution. Our results on two simulated and real datasets of Angiosperms and HIV and a wide selection of rate distributions show that MD-Cat is often more accurate than the alternatives, especially on datasets with nonmodal or multimodal clock models.

              Motivation
              Branch lengths and topology of a species tree are essential in most downstream analyses, including estimation of diversification dates, characterization of selection, understanding adaptation, and comparative genomics. Modern phylogenomic analyses often use methods that account for the heterogeneity of evolutionary histories across the genome due to processes such as incomplete lineage sorting. However, these methods typically do not generate branch lengths in units that are usable by downstream applications, forcing phylogenomic analyses to resort to alternative shortcuts such as estimating branch lengths by concatenating gene alignments into a supermatrix. Yet, concatenation and other available approaches for estimating branch lengths fail to address heterogeneity across the genome.
            
            
              Results
              In this article, we derive expected values of gene tree branch lengths in substitution units under an extension of the multispecies coalescent (MSC) model that allows substitutions with varying rates across the species tree. We present CASTLES, a new technique for estimating branch lengths on the species tree from estimated gene trees that uses these expected values, and our study shows that CASTLES improves on the most accurate prior methods with respect to both speed and accuracy.

However, estimating the diversity of bacterial communities—the number and the total length of distinct genomes within a metagenome—remains an open problem in microbial ecology. Here, we describe an algorithm for estimating the microbial diversity in a metagenomic sample based on a joint analysis of short and long reads. Unlike previous approaches, the algorithm does not make any assumptions on the distribution of the frequencies of genomes within a metagenome (as in parametric methods) and does not require a large database that covers the total diversity (as in non-parametric methods). We estimate that genomes comprising a human gut metagenome have total length varying from 1.3 to 3.5 billion nucleotides, with genomes responsible for 50\% of total abundance having total length varying from only 25 to 61 million nucleotides. In contrast, genomes comprising an aquifer sediment metagenome have more than two orders of magnitude larger total length (≈840 billion nucleotides). We present a method for estimating the diversity of metagenomic samples that combines short and long sequencing reads. We show that our method is capable of capturing rare species and apply it to analyze diversity of the human gut and aquifer sediment metagenomes.},

Incomplete lineage sorting is one cause of discordance that bridges population genetic and phylogenetic processes. ASTRAL is a species tree reconstruction method that seeks to find the tree with minimum quartet distance to an input set of inferred gene trees. However, the published ASTRAL algorithm only works with one sample per species. To account for polymorphisms in present-day species, one can sample multiple individuals per species to create multi-allele datasets. Here, we introduce how ASTRAL can handle multi-allele datasets. We show that the quartet-based optimization problem extends naturally, and we introduce heuristic methods for building the search space specifically for the case of multi-individual datasets. We study the accuracy and scalability of the multi-individual version of ASTRAL-III using extensive simulation studies and compare it to NJst, the only other scalable method that can handle these datasets. We do not find strong evidence that using multiple individuals dramatically improves accuracy. When we study the trade-off between sampling more genes versus more individuals, we find that sampling more genes is more effective than sampling more individuals, even under conditions that we study where trees are shallow (median length: ≈ 1Ne) and ILS is extremely high.},

              Motivation
              The phylogenetic signal of structural variation informs a more comprehensive understanding of evolution. As (near-)complete genome assembly becomes more commonplace, the next methodological challenge for inferring genome rearrangement trees is the identification of syntenic blocks of orthologous sequences. In this article, we studied 94 reference quality genomes of primarily Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) isolates as a benchmark to evaluate these methods. The clonal nature of Mtb evolution, the manageable genome sizes, along with substantial levels of structural variation make this an ideal benchmarking dataset.
            
            
              Results
              We tested several methods for detecting homology and obtaining syntenic blocks and two methods for inferring phylogenies from them, then compared the resulting trees to the standard method’s tree, inferred from nucleotide substitutions. We found that, not only the choice of methods, but also their parameters can impact results, and that the tree inference method had less impact than the block determination method. Interestingly, a rearrangement tree based on blocks from the Cactus whole-genome aligner was fully compatible with the highly supported branches of the substitution-based tree, enabling the combination of the two into a high-resolution supertree. Overall, our results indicate that accurate trees can be inferred using genome rearrangements, but the choice of the methods for inferring homology requires care.

              Background
              A number of algorithms have been developed for calculating the quartet distance between two evolutionary trees on the same set of species. The quartet distance is the number of quartets – sub-trees induced by four leaves – that differs between the trees. Mostly, these algorithms are restricted to work on binary trees, but recently we have developed algorithms that work on trees of arbitrary degree.

                are the maximal number of non-leaf nodes adjacent to a non-leaf node in

                and
                T'
                , respectively. The fastest algorithms previously published for arbitrary degree trees run in
                O

                n

              Conclusion
              We present a new algorithm for computing the quartet distance between two trees of arbitrary degree. The new algorithm improves the asymptotic running time for computing the quartet distance, compared to previous methods, and experimental results indicate that the new method also performs significantly better in practice.},

            How the avian sex chromosomes first evolved from autosomes remains elusive as 100 million years (My) of divergence and degeneration obscure their evolutionary history. The Sylvioidea group of songbirds is interesting for understanding avian sex chromosome evolution because a chromosome fusion event ∼24 Ma formed “neo-sex chromosomes” consisting of an added (new) and an ancestral (old) part. Here, we report the complete female genome (ZW) of one Sylvioidea species, the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus). Our long-read assembly shows that the added region has been translocated to both Z and W, and whereas the added-Z has retained its gene order the added-W part has been heavily rearranged. Phylogenetic analyses show that recombination between the homologous added-Z and -W regions continued after the fusion event, and that recombination suppression across this region took several million years to be completed. Moreover, recombination suppression was initiated across multiple positions over the added-Z, which is not consistent with a simple linear progression starting from the fusion point. As expected following recombination suppression, the added-W show signs of degeneration including repeat accumulation and gene loss. Finally, we present evidence for nonrandom maintenance of slowly evolving and dosage-sensitive genes on both ancestral- and added-W, a process causing correlated evolution among orthologous genes across broad taxonomic groups, regardless of sex linkage.},

The availability of complete genome sequences for two bird species, the chicken and the zebra finch, provides, for the first time, an ideal opportunity to analyze the relationship between structural genomic variation (chromosomal and CNV) and recombination on a genome-wide level. The aims of this study were therefore threefold: (1) to combine bioinformatics, physical mapping to produce comprehensive comparative maps of the genomes of chicken and zebra finch. In so doing, this allowed the identification of evolutionary chromosomal rearrangements distinguishing them. The previously reported interchromosomal conservation of synteny was confirmed, but a larger than expected number of intrachromosomal rearrangements were reported; (2) to hybridize zebra finch genomic DNA to a chicken tiling path microarray and identify CNVs in the zebra finch genome relative to chicken; 32 interspecific CNVs were identified; and (3) to test the hypothesis that there is an association between CNV, chromosomal rearrangements, and recombination by correlating data from (1) and (2) with recombination rate data from a high-resolution genetic linkage map of the zebra finch. We found a highly significant association of both chromosomal rearrangements and CNVs with elevated recombination rates.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Phylogenomic analyses routinely estimate species trees using methods that account for gene tree discordance. However, the most scalable species tree inference methods, which summarize independently inferred gene trees to obtain a species tree, are sensitive to hard-to-avoid errors introduced in the gene tree estimation step. This dilemma has created much debate on the merits of concatenation versus summary methods and practical obstacles to using summary methods more widely and to the exclusion of concatenation. The most successful attempt at making summary methods resilient to noisy gene trees has been contracting low support branches from the gene trees. Unfortunately, this approach requires arbitrary thresholds and poses new challenges. Here, we introduce threshold-free weighting schemes for the quartet-based species tree inference, the metric used in the popular method ASTRAL. By reducing the impact of quartets with low support or long terminal branches (or both), weighting provides stronger theoretical guarantees and better empirical performance than the unweighted ASTRAL. Our simulations show that weighting improves accuracy across many conditions and reduces the gap with concatenation in conditions with low gene tree discordance and high noise. On empirical data, weighting improves congruence with concatenation and increases support. Together, our results show that weighting, enabled by a new optimization algorithm we introduce, improves the utility of summary methods and can reduce the incongruence often observed across analytical pipelines.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Dating phylogenetic trees to obtain branch lengths in the unit of time is essential for many downstream applications but has remained challenging. Dating requires inferring mutation rates that can change across the tree. While we can assume to have information about a small subset of nodes from the fossil record or sampling times (for fast-evolving organisms), inferring the ages of the other nodes essentially requires extrapolation and interpolation. Assuming a clock model that defines a distribution over rates, we can formulate dating as a constrained maximum likelihood (ML) estimation problem. While ML dating methods exist, their accuracy degrades in the face of model misspecification where the assumed parametric statistical clock model vastly differs from the true distribution. Notably, existing methods tend to assume rigid, often unimodal rate distributions. A second challenge is that the likelihood function involves an integral over the continuous domain of the rates and often leads to difficult non-convex optimization problems. To tackle these two challenges, we propose a new method called Molecular Dating using Categorical-models (MD-Cat). MD-Cat uses a categorical model of rates inspired by non-parametric statistics and can approximate a large family of models by discretizing the rate distribution into k categories. Under this model, we can use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to co-estimate rate categories and branch lengths in the time unit. Our model has fewer assumptions about the true clock model than parametric models such as Gamma or LogNormal distribution. Our results on two simulated and real datasets of Angiosperms and HIV and a wide selection of rate distributions show that MD-Cat is often more accurate than the alternatives, especially on datasets with nonmodal or multimodal clock models.

            With incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), the genealogy of closely related species differs along their genomes. The amount of ILS depends on population parameters such as the ancestral effective population sizes and the recombination rate, but also on the number of generations between speciation events. We use a hidden Markov model parameterized according to coalescent theory to infer the genealogy along a four-species genome alignment of closely related species and estimate population parameters. We analyze a basic, panmictic demographic model and study its properties using an extensive set of coalescent simulations. We assess the effect of the model assumptions and demonstrate that the Markov property provides a good approximation to the ancestral recombination graph. Using a too restricted set of possible genealogies, necessary to reduce the computational load, can bias parameter estimates. We propose a simple correction for this bias and suggest directions for future extensions of the model. We show that the patterns of ILS along a sequence alignment can be recovered efficiently together with the ancestral recombination rate. Finally, we introduce an extension of the basic model that allows for mutation rate heterogeneity and reanalyze human–chimpanzee–gorilla–orangutan alignments, using the new models. We expect that this framework will prove useful for population genomics and provide exciting insights into genome evolution.},

            Summary: Targeted enrichment of conserved and ultraconserved genomic elements allows universal collection of phylogenomic data from hundreds of species at multiple time scales (\&lt;5 Ma to \&gt; 300 Ma). Prior to downstream inference, data from these types of targeted enrichment studies must undergo preprocessing to assemble contigs from sequence data; identify targeted, enriched loci from the off-target background data; align enriched contigs representing conserved loci to one another; and prepare and manipulate these alignments for subsequent phylogenomic inference. PHYLUCE is an efficient and easy-to-install software package that accomplishes these tasks across hundreds of taxa and thousands of enriched loci.

            Motivation: Large multiple genome alignments and inferred ancestral genomes are ideal resources for comparative studies of molecular evolution, and advances in sequencing and computing technology are making them increasingly obtainable. These structures can provide a rich understanding of the genetic relationships between all subsets of species they contain. Current formats for storing genomic alignments, such as XMFA and MAF, are all indexed or ordered using a single reference genome, however, which limits the information that can be queried with respect to other species and clades. This loss of information grows with the number of species under comparison, as well as their phylogenetic distance.
            Results: We present HAL, a compressed, graph-based hierarchical alignment format for storing multiple genome alignments and ancestral reconstructions. HAL graphs are indexed on all genomes they contain. Furthermore, they are organized phylogenetically, which allows for modular and parallel access to arbitrary subclades without fragmentation because of rearrangements that have occurred in other lineages. HAL graphs can be created or read with a comprehensive C++ API. A set of tools is also provided to perform basic operations, such as importing and exporting data, identifying mutations and coordinate mapping (liftover).
            Availability: All documentation and source code for the HAL API and tools are freely available at http://github.com/glennhickey/hal.

            Supergenes are sets of genes that are inherited as a single marker and encode complex phenotypes through their joint action. They are identified in an increasing number of organisms, yet their origins and evolution remain enigmatic. In Atlantic cod, four megabase-scale supergenes have been identified and linked to migratory lifestyle and environmental adaptations. Here we investigate the origin and maintenance of these four supergenes through analysis of whole-genome-sequencing data, including a new long-read-based genome assembly for a non-migratory Atlantic cod individual. We corroborate the finding that chromosomal inversions underlie all four supergenes, and we show that they originated at different times between 0.40 and 1.66 million years ago. We reveal gene flux between supergene haplotypes where migratory and stationary Atlantic cod co-occur and conclude that this gene flux is driven by gene conversion, on the basis of an increase in GC content in exchanged sites. Additionally, we find evidence for double crossover between supergene haplotypes, leading to the exchange of an {\textasciitilde}275 kilobase fragment with genes potentially involved in adaptation to low salinity in the Baltic Sea. Our results suggest that supergenes can be maintained over long timescales in the same way as hybridizing species, through the selective purging of introduced genetic variation.},

            We study the evolution of inversions that capture locally adapted alleles when two populations are exchanging migrants or hybridizing. By suppressing recombination between the loci, a new inversion can spread. Neither drift nor coadaptation between the alleles (epistasis) is needed, so this local adaptation mechanism may apply to a broader range of genetic and demographic situations than alternative hypotheses that have been widely discussed. The mechanism can explain many features observed in inversion systems. It will drive an inversion to high frequency if there is no countervailing force, which could explain fixed differences observed between populations and species. An inversion can be stabilized at an intermediate frequency if it also happens to capture one or more deleterious recessive mutations, which could explain polymorphisms that are common in some species. This polymorphism can cycle in frequency with the changing selective advantage of the locally favored alleles. The mechanism can establish underdominant inversions that decrease heterokaryotype fitness by several percent if the cause of fitness loss is structural, while if the cause is genic there is no limit to the strength of underdominance that can result. The mechanism is expected to cause loci responsible for adaptive species-specific differences to map to inversions, as seen in recent QTL studies. We discuss data that support the hypothesis, review other mechanisms for inversion evolution, and suggest possible tests.},

              High-quality and complete reference genome assemblies are fundamental for the application of genomics to biology, disease, and biodiversity conservation. However, such assemblies are available for only a few non-microbial species
              1–4
              . To address this issue, the international Genome 10K (G10K) consortium
              5,6
              has worked over a five-year period to evaluate and develop cost-effective methods for assembling highly accurate and nearly complete reference genomes. Here we present lessons learned from generating assemblies for 16 species that represent six major vertebrate lineages. We confirm that long-read sequencing technologies are essential for maximizing genome quality, and that unresolved complex repeats and haplotype heterozygosity are major sources of assembly error when not handled correctly. Our assemblies correct substantial errors, add missing sequence in some of the best historical reference genomes, and reveal biological discoveries. These include the identification of many false gene duplications, increases in gene sizes, chromosome rearrangements that are specific to lineages, a repeated independent chromosome breakpoint in bat genomes, and a canonical GC-rich pattern in protein-coding genes and their regulatory regions. Adopting these lessons, we have embarked on the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP), an international effort to generate high-quality, complete reference genomes for all of the roughly 70,000 extant vertebrate species and to help to enable a new era of discovery across the life sciences.},

            Lake Tanganyika is the oldest and phenotypically most diverse of the three East African cichlid fish adaptive radiations. It is also the cradle for the younger parallel haplochromine cichlid radiations in Lakes Malawi and Victoria. Despite its evolutionary significance, the relationships among the main Lake Tanganyika lineages remained unresolved, as did the general timescale of cichlid evolution. Here, we disentangle the deep phylogenetic structure of the Lake Tanganyika radiation using anchored phylogenomics and uncover hybridization at its base, as well as early in the haplochromine radiation. This suggests that hybridization might have facilitated these speciation bursts. Time-calibrated trees support that the radiation of Tanganyika cichlids coincided with lake formation and that Gondwanan vicariance concurred with the earliest splits in the cichlid family tree. Genes linked to key innovations show signals of introgression or positive selection following colonization of lake habitats and species’ dietary adaptations are revealed as major drivers of colour vision evolution. These findings shed light onto the processes shaping the evolution of adaptive radiations.},

            Understanding why some evolutionary lineages generate exceptionally high species diversity is an important goal in evolutionary biology. Haplochromine cichlid fishes of Africa’s Lake Victoria region encompass {\textgreater}700 diverse species that all evolved in the last 150,000 years. How this ‘Lake Victoria Region Superflock’ could evolve on such rapid timescales is an enduring question. Here, we demonstrate that hybridization between two divergent lineages facilitated this process by providing genetic variation that subsequently became recombined and sorted into many new species. Notably, the hybridization event generated exceptional allelic variation at an opsin gene known to be involved in adaptation and speciation. More generally, differentiation between new species is accentuated around variants that were fixed differences between the parental lineages, and that now appear in many new combinations in the radiation species. We conclude that hybridization between divergent lineages, when coincident with ecological opportunity, may facilitate rapid and extensive adaptive radiation.},

            Presumably, due to a rapid early diversification, major parts of the higher-level phylogeny of birds are still resolved controversially in different analyses or are considered unresolvable. To address this problem, we produced an avian tree of life, which includes molecular sequences of one or several species of ∼90\% of the currently recognized family-level taxa (429 species, 379 genera) including all 106 family-level taxa of the nonpasserines and 115 of the passerines (Passeriformes). The unconstrained analyses of noncoding 3-prime untranslated region (3′-UTR) sequences and those of coding sequences yielded different trees. In contrast to the coding sequences, the 3′-UTR sequences resulted in a well-resolved and stable tree topology. The 3′-UTR contained, unexpectedly, transcription factor binding motifs that were specific for different higher-level taxa. In this tree, grebes and flamingos are the sister clade of all other Neoaves, which are subdivided into five major clades. All nonpasserine taxa were placed with robust statistical support including the long-time enigmatic hoatzin (Opisthocomiformes), which was found being the sister taxon of the Caprimulgiformes. The comparatively late radiation of family-level clades of the songbirds (oscine Passeriformes) contrasts with the attenuated diversification of nonpasseriform taxa since the early Miocene. This correlates with the evolution of vocal production learning, an important speciation factor, which is ancestral for songbirds and evolved convergent only in hummingbirds and parrots. As 3′-UTR-based phylotranscriptomics resolved the avian family-level tree of life, we suggest that this procedure will also resolve the all-species avian tree of life},

            The mouse has been one of the main mammalian model organisms used for genetic and biomedical research. Understanding the evolution of house mouse genomes would shed light not only on genetic interactions and their interplay with traits in the mouse but would also have significant implications for human genetics and health. Analysis using a recently developed statistical method shows that the house mouse genome is a mosaic that contains previously unrecognized contributions from a different mouse species. We traced these contributions to ancient and recent interbreeding events. Our findings reveal the extent of introgression in an important mammalian genome and provide an approach for genome-wide scans of introgression in other eukaryotic genomes.
          , 
            
              We report on a genome-wide scan for introgression between the house mouse (
              Mus musculus domesticus
              ) and the Algerian mouse (
              Mus spretus
              ), using samples from the ranges of sympatry and allopatry in Africa and Europe. Our analysis reveals wide variability in introgression signatures along the genomes, as well as across the samples. We find that fewer than half of the autosomes in each genome harbor all detectable introgression, whereas the X chromosome has none. Further, European mice carry more
              M. spretus
              alleles than the sympatric African ones. Using the length distribution and sharing patterns of introgressed genomic tracts across the samples, we infer, first, that at least three distinct hybridization events involving
              M. spretus
              have occurred, one of which is ancient, and the other two are recent (one presumably due to warfarin rodenticide selection). Second, several of the inferred introgressed tracts contain genes that are likely to confer adaptive advantage. Third, introgressed tracts might contain driver genes that determine the evolutionary fate of those tracts. Further, functional analysis revealed introgressed genes that are essential to fitness, including the
              Vkorc1
              gene, which is implicated in rodenticide resistance, and olfactory receptor genes. Our findings highlight the extent and role of introgression in nature and call for careful analysis and interpretation of house mouse data in evolutionary and genetic studies.},

            ABSTRACT
            
              High-throughput sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons has facilitated understanding of complex microbial communities, but the inherent noise in PCR and DNA sequencing limits differentiation of closely related bacteria. Although many scientific questions can be addressed with broad taxonomic profiles, clinical, food safety, and some ecological applications require higher specificity. Here we introduce a novel sub-operational-taxonomic-unit (sOTU) approach, Deblur, that uses error profiles to obtain putative error-free sequences from Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq sequencing platforms. Deblur substantially reduces computational demands relative to similar sOTU methods and does so with similar or better sensitivity and specificity. Using simulations, mock mixtures, and real data sets, we detected closely related bacterial sequences with single nucleotide differences while removing false positives and maintaining stability in detection, suggesting that Deblur is limited only by read length and diversity within the amplicon sequences. Because Deblur operates on a per-sample level, it scales to modern data sets and meta-analyses. To highlight Deblur’s ability to integrate data sets, we include an interactive exploration of its application to multiple distinct sequencing rounds of the American Gut Project. Deblur is open source under the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license, easily installable, and downloadable from
              https://github.com/biocore/deblur

	abstract = {We introduce the operational genomic unit (OGU) method, a metagenome analysis strategy that directly exploits sequence alignment hits to individual reference genomes as the minimum unit for assessing the diversity of microbial communities and their relevance to environmental factors. This approach is independent of taxonomic classification, granting the possibility of maximal resolution of community composition, and organizes features into an accurate hierarchy using a phylogenomic tree. The outputs are suitable for contemporary analytical protocols for community ecology, differential abundance, and supervised learning while supporting phylogenetic methods, such as UniFrac and phylofactorization, that are seldom applied to shotgun metagenomics despite being prevalent in 16S rRNA gene amplicon studies. As demonstrated in two real-world case studies, the OGU method produces biologically meaningful patterns from microbiome data sets. Such patterns further remain detectable at very low metagenomic sequencing depths. Compared with taxonomic unit-based analyses implemented in currently adopted metagenomics tools, and the analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence variants, this method shows superiority in informing biologically relevant insights, including stronger correlation with body environment and host sex on the Human Microbiome Project data set and more accurate prediction of human age by the gut microbiomes of Finnish individuals included in the FINRISK 2002 cohort. We provide Woltka, a bioinformatics tool to implement this method, with full integration with the QIIME 2 package and the Qiita web platform, to facilitate adoption of the OGU method in future metagenomics studies. IMPORTANCE Shotgun metagenomics is a powerful, yet computationally challenging, technique compared to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing for decoding the composition and structure of microbial communities. Current analyses of metagenomic data are primarily based on taxonomic classification, which is limited in feature resolution. To solve these challenges, we introduce operational genomic units (OGUs), which are the individual reference genomes derived from sequence alignment results, without further assigning them taxonomy. The OGU method advances current read-based metagenomics in two dimensions: (i) providing maximal resolution of community composition and (ii) permitting use of phylogeny-aware tools. Our analysis of real-world data sets shows that it is advantageous over currently adopted metagenomic analysis methods and the finest-grained 16S rRNA analysis methods in predicting biological traits. We thus propose the adoption of OGUs as an effective practice in metagenomic studies.},

While there has been substantial progress in developing methods that estimate a species tree given a collection of gene trees, less attention has been paid to fast and accurate methods of quantifying support. In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm to compute quartet-based support for each branch of a given species tree with regard to a given set of gene trees. We then show how the quartet support can be used in the context of the multi-species coalescent model to compute i) the local posterior probability that the branch is in the species tree and ii) the length of the branch in coalescent units. We evaluate the precision and recall of the local posterior probability on a wide set of simulated and biological datasets, and show that it has very high precision and improved recall compared to multi-locus bootstrapping. The estimated branch lengths are highly accurate when gene tree estimation error is low, but are underestimated when gene tree estimation error increases. Computation of both the branch length and the local posterior probability is implemented as new features in ASTRAL.},

            DNA-based approaches to systematics have changed dramatically during the last two decades with the rise of DNA barcoding methods and newer multi-locus methods for species delimitation. During the last half-decade, partly driven by the new sequencing technologies, the focus has shifted to multi-locus sequence data and the identification of species within the framework of the multi-species coalescent (MSC). In this paper, I discuss model-based Bayesian methods for species delimitation that have been developed in recent years using the MSC. Several approximate methods for species delimitation (and their limitations) are also discussed. Explicit species delimitation models have the advantage of clarifying more precisely what is being delimited and what assumptions we are making in doing so. Moreover, the methods can be very powerful when applied to large multi-locus datasets and thus take full advantage of data generated using today’s technologies.},

Punctuational effects occur at more than twice the rate in plants and fungi than in animals, but the proportion of total divergence attributable to punctuational change does not vary among these groups. Punctuational changes cause departures from a clock-like tempo of evolution, suggesting that they should be accounted for in deriving dates from phylogenies.

In addition, large differences in family size have generally been attributed to the effects of natural selection, without a strong statistical basis for these conclusions. Here we use a model of stochastic birth and death for gene family evolution and show that it can be efficiently applied to multispecies genome comparisons. This model takes into account the lengths of branches on phylogenetic trees, as well as duplication and deletion rates, and hence provides expectations for divergence in gene family size among lineages. The model offers both the opportunity to identify large-scale patterns in genome evolution and the ability to make stronger inferences regarding the role of natural selection in gene family expansion or contraction. We apply our method to data from the genomes of five yeast species to show its applicability.},

	abstract = {Core gene phylogenies provide a window into early evolution, but different gene sets and analytical methods have yielded substantially different views of the tree of life. Trees inferred from a small set of universal core genes have typically supported a long branch separating the archaeal and bacterial domains. By contrast, recent analyses of a broader set of non-ribosomal genes have suggested that Archaea may be less divergent from Bacteria, and that estimates of inter-domain distance are inflated due to accelerated evolution of ribosomal proteins along the inter-domain branch. Resolving this debate is key to determining the diversity of the archaeal and bacterial domains, the shape of the tree of life, and our understanding of the early course of cellular evolution. Here, we investigate the evolutionary history of the marker genes key to the debate. We show that estimates of a reduced Archaea-Bacteria (AB) branch length result from inter-domain gene transfers and hidden paralogy in the expanded marker gene set. By contrast, analysis of a broad range of manually curated marker gene datasets from an evenly sampled set of 700 Archaea and Bacteria reveals that current methods likely underestimate the AB branch length due to substitutional saturation and poor model fit; that the best-performing phylogenetic markers tend to support longer inter-domain branch lengths; and that the AB branch lengths of ribosomal and non-ribosomal marker genes are statistically indistinguishable. Furthermore, our phylogeny inferred from the 27 highest-ranked marker genes recovers a clade of DPANN at the base of the Archaea and places the bacterial Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) within Bacteria as the sister group to the Chloroflexota.},

            ABSTRACT
            The horseshoe effect is a phenomenon that has long intrigued ecologists. The effect was commonly thought to be an artifact of dimensionality reduction, and multiple techniques were developed to unravel this phenomenon and simplify interpretation. Here, we provide evidence that horseshoes arise as a consequence of distance metrics that saturate—a familiar concept in other fields but new to microbial ecology. This saturation property loses information about community dissimilarity, simply because it cannot discriminate between samples that do not share any common features. The phenomenon illuminates niche differentiation in microbial communities and indicates species turnover along environmental gradients. Here we propose a rationale for the observed horseshoe effect from multiple dimensionality reduction techniques applied to simulations, soil samples, and samples from postmortem mice. An in-depth understanding of this phenomenon allows targeting of niche differentiation patterns from high-level ordination plots, which can guide conventional statistical tools to pinpoint microbial niches along environmental gradients.

Advances in high-throughput sequencing have enabled deep scans of B cell receptor repertoires, paving the way for reconstructing clonal trees. However, it is not clear if clonal trees, which capture microevolutionary time scales, can be reconstructed using traditional phylogenetic reconstruction methods with adequate accuracy. In fact, several clonal tree reconstruction methods have been developed to fix supposed shortcomings of phylogenetic methods. Nevertheless, no consensus has been reached regarding the relative accuracy of these methods, partially because evaluation is challenging. Benchmarking the performance of existing methods and developing better methods would both benefit from realistic models of clonal lineage evolution specifically designed for emulating B cell evolution. In this paper, we propose a model for modeling B cell clonal lineage evolution and use this model to benchmark several existing clonal tree reconstruction methods. Our model, designed to be extensible, has several features: by evolving the clonal tree and sequences simultaneously, it allows modeling selective pressure due to changes in affinity binding; it enables scalable simulations of large numbers of cells; it enables several rounds of infection by an evolving pathogen; and, it models building of memory. In addition, we also suggest a set of metrics for comparing clonal trees and measuring their properties. Our results show that while maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction methods can fail to capture key features of clonal tree expansion if applied naively, a simple post-processing of their results, where short branches are contracted, leads to inferences that are better than alternative methods.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Placing new sequences onto reference phylogenies is increasingly used for analyzing environmental samples, especially microbiomes. Existing placement methods assume that query sequences have evolved under specific models directly on the reference phylogeny. For example, they assume single-gene data (e.g., 16S rRNA amplicons) have evolved under the GTR model on a gene tree. Placement, however, often has a more ambitious goal: extending a (genome-wide) species tree given data from individual genes without knowing the evolutionary model. Addressing this challenging problem requires new directions. Here, we introduce Deep-learning Enabled Phylogenetic Placement (DEPP), an algorithm that learns to extend species trees using single genes without prespecified models. In simulations and on real data, we show that DEPP can match the accuracy of model-based methods without any prior knowledge of the model. We also show that DEPP can update the multilocus microbial tree-of-life with single genes with high accuracy. We further demonstrate that DEPP can combine 16S and metagenomic data onto a single tree, enabling community structure analyses that take advantage of both sources of data.

We derive the expectation and variance of the number of mutated k-mers and of the number of islands (a maximal interval of mutated k-mers) and oceans (a maximal interval of non-mutated k-mers). We then derive hypothesis tests and confidence intervals (CIs) for r given an observed number of mutated k-mers, or, alternatively, given the Jaccard similarity (with or without MinHash). We demonstrate the usefulness of our results using a few select applications: obtaining a CI to supplement the Mash distance point estimate, filtering out reads during alignment by Minimap2, and rating long-read alignments to a de Bruijn graph by Jabba.},

This protocol introduces the procedures for building a phylogenetic tree of a large number of microbial genomes using a broad sampling of marker genes that are representative of whole-genome evolution. The protocol highlights the use of a gene tree summary method, which can effectively reconstruct the species tree while accounting for the topological conflicts among individual gene trees. The pipeline described in this protocol is scalable to tens of thousands of genomes while retaining high accuracy. We discussed multiple software tools, libraries, and scripts to enable convenient adoption of the protocol.

Such placements are often obtained from incomplete and noisy data, making it essential to augment the results with some notion of uncertainty. While the standard likelihood-based methods designed for placement naturally provide such measures of uncertainty, the newer and more scalable distance-based methods lack this crucial feature. Here, we adopt several parametric and nonparametric sampling methods for measuring the support of phylogenetic placements that have been obtained with the use of distances. Comparing the alternative strategies, we conclude that nonparametric bootstrapping is more accurate than the alternatives. We go on to show how bootstrapping can be performed efficiently using a linear algebraic formulation that makes it up to 30 times faster and implement this optimized version as part of the distance-based placement software APPLES. By examining a wide range of applications, we show that the relative accuracy of maximum likelihood (ML) support values as compared to distance-based methods depends on the application and the dataset. ML is advantageous for fragmentary queries, while distance-based support values are more accurate for full-length and multi-gene datasets. With the quantification of uncertainty, our work fills a crucial gap that prevents the broader adoption of distance-based placement tools.},

	abstract = {Many recent phylogenetic methods have focused on accurately inferring species trees when there is gene tree discordance due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). For almost all of these methods, and for phylogenetic methods in general, the data for each locus are assumed to consist of orthologous, single-copy sequences. Loci that are present in more than a single copy in any of the studied genomes are excluded from the data. These steps greatly reduce the number of loci available for analysis. The question we seek to answer in this study is: what happens if one runs such species tree inference methods on data where paralogy is present, in addition to or without ILS being present? Through simulation studies and analyses of two large biological data sets, we show that running such methods on data with paralogs can still provide accurate results. We use multiple different methods, some of which are based directly on the multispecies coalescent model, and some of which have been proven to be statistically consistent under it. We also treat the paralogous loci in multiple ways: from explicitly denoting them as paralogs, to randomly selecting one copy per species. In all cases, the inferred species trees are as accurate as equivalent analyses using single-copy orthologs. Our results have significant implications for the use of ILS-aware phylogenomic analyses, demonstrating that they do not have to be restricted to single-copy loci. This will greatly increase the amount of data that can be used for phylogenetic inference.[Gene duplication and loss; incomplete lineage sorting; multispecies coalescent; orthology; paralogy.]},

	abstract = {Species tree inference from gene family trees is a significant problem in computational biology. However, gene tree heterogeneity, which can be caused by several factors including gene duplication and loss, makes the estimation of species trees very challenging. While there have been several species tree estimation methods introduced in recent years to specifically address gene tree heterogeneity due to gene duplication and loss (such as DupTree, FastMulRFS, ASTRAL-Pro, and SpeciesRax), many incur high cost in terms of both running time and memory. We introduce a new approach, DISCO, that decomposes the multi-copy gene family trees into many single copy trees, which allows for methods previously designed for species tree inference in a single copy gene tree context to be used. We prove that using DISCO with ASTRAL (i.e., ASTRAL-DISCO) is statistically consistent under the GDL model, provided that ASTRAL-Pro correctly roots and tags each gene family tree. We evaluate DISCO paired with different methods for estimating species trees from single copy genes (e.g., ASTRAL, ASTRID, and IQ-TREE) under a wide range of model conditions, and establish that high accuracy can be obtained even when ASTRAL-Pro is not able to correctly roots and tags the gene family trees. We also compare results using MI, an alternative decomposition strategy from Yang Y. and Smith S.A. (2014), and find that DISCO provides better accuracy, most likely as a result of covering more of the gene family tree leafset in the output decomposition.

	abstract = {While aligning sequences has been the dominant approach for determining homology prior to phylogenetic inference, alignment-free methods have much appeal in terms of simplifying the process of inference, especially when analyzing genome-wide data. Furthermore, alignment-free methods present the only option for some emerging forms of data, such as genome skims, which cannot be assembled. Despite the appeal, alignment-free methods have not been competitive with alignment-based methods in terms of accuracy. One limitation of alignment-free methods is that they typically rely on simplified models of sequence evolution such as Jukes-Cantor. It is possible to compute pairwise distances under more complex models by computing frequencies of base substitutions provided that these quantities can be estimated in the alignment-free setting. A particular limitation is that for many forms of genomewide data, which arguably present the best use case for alignment-free methods, the strand of DNA sequences is unknown. Under such conditions, the so-called no-strand bias models are the most complex models that can be used. Here, we show how to calculate distances under a no-strain bias restriction of the General Time Reversible (GTR) model called TK4 without relying on alignments. The method relies on replacing letters in the input sequences, and subsequent computation of Jaccard indices between k-mer sets. For the method to work on large genomes, we also need to compute the number of k-mer mismatches after replacement due to random chance as opposed to homology. We show in simulation that these alignment-free distances can be highly accurate when genomes evolve under the assumed models, and we examine the effectiveness of the method on real genomic data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Using unassembled reads needs contamination detection because samples often include reads from unintended groups of species. Similarly, assembling the organelle genome needs distinguishing organelle and nuclear reads. While k-mer-based methods have shown promise in read-matching, prior studies have shown that existing methods are insufficiently sensitive for contamination detection. Here, we introduce a new read-matching tool called CONSULT that tests whether k-mers from a query fall within a user-specified distance of the reference dataset using locality-sensitive hashing. Taking advantage of large memory machines available nowadays, CONSULT libraries accommodate tens of thousands of microbial species. Our results show that CONSULT has higher true-positive and lower false-positive rates of contamination detection than leading methods such as Kraken-II and improves distance calculation from genome skims. We also demonstrate that CONSULT can distinguish organelle reads from nuclear reads, leading to dramatic improvements in skim-based mitochondrial assemblies.},

	doi = {10.1101/725424},
	abstract = {Constructing antibody repertoires is an important error-correcting step in analyzing immunosequencing datasets that is important for reconstructing evolutionary (clonal) development of antibodies. However, the state-of-the-art repertoire construction tools typically miss low-abundance antibodies that often represent internal nodes in clonal trees and are crucially important for clonal tree reconstruction. Thus, although repertoire construction is a prerequisite for follow up clonal tree reconstruction, the existing repertoire reconstruction algorithms are not well suited for this task. Since clonal analysis has the potential to reveal errors in the constructed repertoires and contribute to constructing more accurate repertoires, we advocate a tree-guided construction of antibody repertoires that combines error correction and clonal reconstruction as interconnected (rather than independent) tasks. We developed the IgEvolution algorithm for simultaneous repertoire and clonal tree reconstruction and applied it for analyzing multiple immunosequencing datasets representing antigen-specific immune responses. We demonstrate that analysis of clonal trees reveals highly mutable positions that correlate with antigen-binding sites and light-chain contacts in crystallized antibody-antigen complexes. We further demonstrate that this analysis leads to a new approach for identifying complementarity determining regions (CDRs) in antibodies.},

	abstract = {The antibodies produced initially in response to most antigens are high molecular weight (MW) immunoglobulins (IgM) with low affinity for the antigen, while the antibodies produced later are lower MW classes (e.g., IgG and IgA) with, on average, orders of magnitude higher affinity for that antigen. These changes, often termed affinity maturation, take place largely in small B-cell clusters (germinal center; GC) in lymphoid tissues in which proliferating antigen-stimulated B cells express the highly mutagenic cytidine deaminase that mediates immunoglobulin class-switching and sequence diversification of the immunoglobulin variable domains of antigen-binding receptors on B cells (BCR). Of the large library of BCR-mutated B cells thus rapidly generated, a small minority with affinity-enhancing mutations are selected to survive and differentiate into long-lived antibody-secreting plasma cells and memory B cells. BCRs are also endocytic receptors; they internalize and cleave BCR-bound antigen, yielding peptide–MHC complexes that are recognized by follicular helper T cells. Imperfect correlation between BCR affinity for antigen and cognate T-cell engagement may account for the increasing affinity heterogeneity that accompanies the increasing average affinity of antibodies. Conservation of mechanisms underlying mutation and selection of high-affinity antibodies over the ≈200 million years of evolution separating bird and mammal lineages points to the crucial role of antibody affinity enhancement in adaptive immunity.

For this reason, the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary history of dolphins are still not very well resolved; the question of whether the genera Tursiops and Stenella are monophyletic is especially controversial. Here, we performed re-sequencing of six dolphin genomes and combined them with eight previously published dolphin SRA datasets and six whole-genome datasets to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of dolphins and test the monophyly hypothesis of Tursiops and Stenella . Phylogenetic reconstruction with the maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods of concatenated loci, as well as with coalescence analyses of sliding window trees, produced a concordant and well-supported tree. Our studies support the non-monophyletic status of Tursiops and Stenella because the species referred these genera do not form exclusive monophyletic clades. This suggests that the current taxonomy of both genera might not reflect their evolutionary history and may underestimate their diversity. A four-taxon D -statistic (ABBA-BABA) test, five-taxon D FOIL test, and tree-based PhyloNet analyses all showed extensive gene flow across dolphin species, which could explain the instability in resolving phylogenetic relationship of oceanic dolphins with different and limited markers . This study could be a good case to demonstrate how genomic data can reveal complex speciation and phylogeny in rapidly radiating animal groups.},

Hardly any [phylogenetic] tree-reconstruction methods meet this simple requirement.” The ability to reject models is of such great importance because the results of all phylogenetic analyses depend on their underlying models—to have confidence in the inferences, it is necessary to have confidence in the models. In this paper, a test statistics suggested by Cox is employed to test the adequacy of some statistical models of DNA sequence evolution used in the phylogenetic inference method introduced by Felsentein. Monte Carlo simulations are used to assess significance levels. The resulting statistical tests provide an objective and very general assessment of all the components of a DNA substitution model; more specific versions of the test are devised to test individual components of a model. In all cases, the new analyses have the additional advantage that values of phylogenetic parameters do not have to be assumed in order to perform the tests. © 1993, Springer-Verlag New York Inc.

Most of them depend on sequence alignment directly or indirectly and, in some cases, need fine-tuning and adjustment. The composition vector method circumvents the ambiguity of choosing the genes for phylogenetic reconstruction and avoids the necessity of aligning sequences of essentially different length and gene content. This new method does not contain 'free' parameter and 'fine-tuning'. A bootstrap test for a phylogenetic tree of 139 organisms has shown the stability of the branchings, which support the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) tree of life in its overall structure and in many details. It may provide a quick reference in prokaryote phylogenetics whenever the proteome of an organism is available, a situation that will become commonplace in the near future.},

The background-subtracting measure \$d\_2{\textasciicircum}*\$ at k = 6 gave the highest host prediction accuracy (33\%, genus level) with reasonable computational times. Requiring a maximum dissimilarity score for making predictions (thresholding) and taking the consensus of the 30 most similar hosts further improved accuracy. Using a previous dataset of 820 bacteriophage and 2699 bacterial genomes, \$d\_2{\textasciicircum}*\$ host prediction accuracies with thresholding and consensus methods (genus-level: 64\%) exceeded previous Euclidian distance ONF (32\%) or homology-based (22-62\%) methods. When applied to metagenomically-assembled marine SUP05 viruses and the human gut virus crAssphage, \$d\_2{\textasciicircum}*\$-based predictions overlapped (i.e. some same, some different) with the previously inferred hosts of these viruses. The extent of overlap improved when only using host genomes or metagenomic contigs from the same habitat or samples as the query viruses.

	abstract = {A fundamental step in any comparative whole genome analysis is the annotation of homology relationships between segments of the genomes. Traditionally, this annotation has been based on coding segments, where orthologous genes are inferred and then syntenic blocks are computed by agglomerating sets of homologous genes into homologous regions. More recently, whole genomes, including intergenic regions, are being aligned de novo as whole genome alignments (WGA). In this article we develop a test to measure to what extent sets of homology relationships given by two different software are hierarchically related to one another, where matched segments from one software may contain matched segments from the other and vice versa. Such a test should be used as a sanity check for an agglomerative syntenic block software, and provides a mapping between the blocks that can be used for further downstream analyses. We show that, in practice, it is rare that two collections of homology relationships are perfectly hierarchically related. Therefore we present an optimization problem to measure how far they are from being so. We show that this problem, which is a generalization of the assignment problem, is NP-Hard and give a heuristic solution and implementation. We apply our distance measure to data from the Alignathon competition, as well as to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, showing that many factors affect how hierarchically related two collections are, including sensitivities to guide trees and the use or omission of an outgroup. These findings inform practitioners on the pitfalls of homology relationship inference, and can inform development of more robust inference tools.},

However, a classical application of these techniques to distances computed between samples can lack transparency because there is no ready interpretation of the axes of classical PCA plots, and it is difficult to assign any clear intuitive meaning to either the internal nodes or the edge lengths of trees produced by distance-based hierarchical clustering methods such as UPGMA. We show that more interesting and interpretable results are produced by two new methods that leverage the special structure of phylogenetic placement data. Edge principal components analysis enables the detection of important differences between samples that contain closely related taxa. Each principal component axis is simply a collection of signed weights on the edges of the phylogenetic tree, and these weights are easily visualized by a suitable thickening and coloring of the edges. Squash clustering outputs a (rooted) clustering tree in which each internal node corresponds to an appropriate "average" of the original samples at the leaves below the node. Moreover, the length of an edge is a suitably defined distance between the averaged samples associated with the two incident nodes, rather than the less interpretable average of distances produced by UPGMA. We present these methods and illustrate their use with data from the microbiome of the human vagina.},

	abstract = {Metagenomics (also referred to as environmental and community genomics) is the genomic analysis of microorganisms by direct extraction and cloning of DNA from an assemblage of microorganisms. The development of metagenomics stemmed from the ineluctable evidence that as-yet-uncultured microorganisms represent the vast majority of organisms in most environments on earth. This evidence was derived from analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences amplified directly from the environment, an approach that avoided the bias imposed by culturing and led to the discovery of vast new lineages of microbial life. Although the portrait of the microbial world was revolutionized by analysis of 16S rRNA genes, such studies yielded only a phylogenetic description of community membership, providing little insight into the genetics, physiology, and biochemistry of the members. Metagenomics provides a second tier of technical innovation that facilitates study of the physiology and ecology of environmental microorganisms. Novel genes and gene products discovered through metagenomics include the first bacteriorhodopsin of bacterial origin; novel small molecules with antimicrobial activity; and new members of families of known proteins, such as an Na(+)(Li(+))/H(+) antiporter, RecA, DNA polymerase, and antibiotic resistance determinants. Reassembly of multiple genomes has provided insight into energy and nutrient cycling within the community, genome structure, gene function, population genetics and microheterogeneity, and lateral gene transfer among members of an uncultured community. The application of metagenomic sequence information will facilitate the design of better culturing strategies to link genomic analysis with pure culture studies.},

This species has a broad geographic distribution extending across tropical and temperate regions of the Americas from Canada to Brazil. Guided by a preliminary observation of the barcode gap between sequences from specimens of L. venusta collected in Florida and other North American localities, we collected across a transect through the southeastern USA to investigate the observed genetic divide. The dataset, complemented with additional samples from Mexico, and Brazil was analyzed for species delimitation using STACEY and bGMYC based on sequences from one nuclear (ITS2) and one mitochondrial marker (COI). The analyses clearly separate USA samples into two deeply divergent and geographically structured groups (north–south) which we interpret as two different species. We generated ecological niche models for these two groups rejecting a niche equivalence hypothesis for these lineages. Taxonomic changes are proposed based on these findings, Leucauge venusta is restricted to denote the northern clade, and its known distribution restricted to the USA. Leucauge argyrobapta (White, 1841) is removed from synonymy to denote the populations in Florida, Mexico and Brazil. Although the delimitation analyses suggest each of these geographic clusters within the L. argyrobapta samples represent different species, more specimens from Central and South America are needed to properly test the cohesion of L. argyrobapta populations.},

The marginal likelihood is the normalizing constant for the posterior density, obtained by integrating the product of the likelihood and the prior with respect to model parameters. Thus, the computational burden of computing the marginal likelihood scales with the dimension of the parameter space. In phylogenetics, where we work with tree topologies that are high-dimensional models, standard approaches to computing marginal likelihoods are very slow. Here, we study methods to quickly compute the marginal likelihood of a single fixed tree topology. We benchmark the speed and accuracy of 19 different methods to compute the marginal likelihood of phylogenetic topologies on a suite of real data sets under the JC69 model. These methods include several new ones that we develop explicitly to solve this problem, as well as existing algorithms that we apply to phylogenetic models for the first time. Altogether, our results show that the accuracy of these methods varies widely, and that accuracy does not necessarily correlate with computational burden. Our newly developed methods are orders of magnitude faster than standard approaches, and in some cases, their accuracy rivals the best established estimators.},

In this paper we present an alternative approach: a variational framework for Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. We approximate the true posterior using an expressive graphical model for tree distributions, called a subsplit Bayesian network, together with appropriate branch length distributions. We train the variational approximation via stochastic gradient ascent and adopt multi-sample based gradient estimators for different latent variables separately to handle the composite latent space of phylogenetic models. We show that our structured variational approximations are flexible enough to provide comparable posterior estimation to MCMC, while requiring less computation due to a more efficient tree exploration mechanism enabled by variational inference. Moreover, the variational approximations can be readily used for further statistical analysis such as marginal likelihood estimation for model comparison via importance sampling. Experiments on both synthetic data and real data Bayesian phylogenetic inference problems demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.},

The ability to perform such studies is currently compromised by the lack of a comprehensive phylogeny for Drosophila and related genera. The genus Drosophila as currently defined is known to be paraphyletic with respect to several other genera, but considerable uncertainty remains about other aspects of the phylogeny. Here, we estimate a phylogeny for 176 drosophilid (12 genera) and four non-drosophilid species, using gene sequences for up to 13 different genes per species (average: 4333 bp, five genes per species). This is the most extensive set of molecular data on drosophilids yet analysed. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted with maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian approaches. Our analysis confirms that the genus Drosophila is paraphyletic with 100\% support in the Bayesian analysis and 90\% bootstrap support in the ML analysis. The subgenus Sophophora , which includes Drosophila melanogaster , is the sister clade of all the other subgenera as well as of most species of six other genera. This sister clade contains two large, well-supported subclades. The first subclade contains the Hawaiian Drosophila , the genus Scaptomyza , and the virilis - repleta radiation. The second contains the immigrans - tripunctata radiation as well as the genera Hirtodrosophila (except Hirtodrosophila duncani ), Mycodrosophila , Zaprionus and Liodrosophila . We argue that these results support a taxonomic revision of the genus Drosophila .},

However, increasing numbers of sequences are now available for a wide variety of species, and phylogenies based on hundreds or thousands of taxa are becoming routine. With phylogenies of this size Felsenstein’s bootstrap tends to yield very low supports, especially on deep branches. Here we propose a new version of the phylogenetic bootstrap in which the presence of inferred branches in replications is measured using a gradual ‘transfer’ distance rather than the binary presence or absence index used in Felsenstein’s original version. The resulting supports are higher and do not induce falsely supported branches. The application of our method to large mammal, HIV and simulated datasets reveals their phylogenetic signals, whereas Felsenstein’s bootstrap fails to do so.},

	abstract = {Metagenomic studies have increasingly utilized sequencing technologies in order to analyze DNA fragments found in environmental samples.One important step in this analysis is the taxonomic classification of the DNA fragments. Conventional read classification methods require large databases and vast amounts of memory to run, with recent deep learning methods suffering from very large model sizes. We therefore aim to develop a more memory-efficient technique for taxonomic classification. A task of particular interest is abundance estimation in metagenomic samples. Current attempts rely on classifying single DNA reads independently from each other and are therefore agnostic to co-occurence patterns between taxa. In this work, we also attempt to take these patterns into account. We develop a novel memory-efficient read classification technique, combining deep learning and locality-sensitive hashing. We show that this approach outperforms conventional mapping-based and other deep learning methods for single-read taxonomic classification when restricting all methods to a fixed memory footprint. Moreover, we formulate the task of abundance estimation as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem and we extend current deep learning architectures with two different types of permutation-invariant MIL pooling layers: a) deepsets and b) attention-based pooling. We illustrate that our architectures can exploit the co-occurrence of species in metagenomic read sets and outperform the single-read architectures in predicting the distribution over taxa at higher taxonomic ranks.},

	abstract = {Full genome data sets are currently being explored on a regular basis to infer phylogenetic trees, but there are often discordances among the trees produced by different genes. An important goal in phylogenomics is to identify which individual gene and species produce the same phylogenetic tree and are thus likely to share the same evolutionary history. On the other hand, it is also essential to identify which genes and species produce discordant topologies and therefore evolve in a different way or represent noise in the data. The latter are outlier genes or species and they can provide a wealth of information on potentially interesting biological processes, such as incomplete lineage sorting, hybridization, and horizontal gene transfers. Here, we propose a new method to explore the genomic tree space and detect outlier genes and species based on multiple co-inertia analysis (MCOA), which efficiently captures and compares the similarities in the phylogenetic topologies produced by individual genes. Our method allows the rapid identification of outlier genes and species by extracting the similarities and discrepancies, in terms of the pairwise distances, between all the species in all the trees, simultaneously. This is achieved by using MCOA, which finds successive decomposition axes from individual ordinations (i.e., derived from distance matrices) that maximize a covariance function. The method is freely available as a set of R functions. The source code and tutorial can be found online at http://phylomcoa.cgenomics.org. © 2012 The Author.},

	abstract = {Summarizing individual gene trees to species phylogenies using two-step coalescent methods is now a standard strategy in the field of phylogenomics. However, practical implementations of summary methods suffer from gene tree estimation error, which is caused by various biological and analytical factors. Greatly understudied is the choice of gene tree inference method and downstream effects on species tree estimation for empirical data sets. To better understand the impact of this method choice on gene and species tree accuracy, we compare gene trees estimated through four widely used programs under different model-selection criteria: PhyloBayes, MrBayes, IQ-Tree, and RAxML. We study their performance in the phylogenomic framework of \$\&gt;\$800 ultraconserved elements from the bee subfamily Nomiinae (Halictidae). Our taxon sampling focuses on the genus Pseudapis, a distinct lineage with diverse morphological features, but contentious morphology-based taxonomic classifications and no molecular phylogenetic guidance. We approximate topological accuracy of gene trees by assessing their ability to recover two uncontroversial, monophyletic groups, and compare branch lengths of individual trees using the stemminess metric (the relative length of internal branches). We further examine different strategies of removing uninformative loci and the collapsing of weakly supported nodes into polytomies. We then summarize gene trees with ASTRAL and compare resulting species phylogenies, including comparisons to concatenation-based estimates. Gene trees obtained with the reversible jump model search in MrBayes were most concordant on average and all Bayesian methods yielded gene trees with better stemminess values. The only gene tree estimation approach whose ASTRAL summary trees consistently produced the most likely correct topology, however, was IQ-Tree with automated model designation (ModelFinder program). We discuss these findings and provide practical advice on gene tree estimation for summary methods. Lastly, we establish the first phylogeny-informed classification for Pseudapis s. l. and map the distribution of distinct morphological features of the group.

Furthermore, while concatenation, a traditional approach to tree estimation, has excellent performance under many conditions, the expectation is that the best accuracy will be obtained through the use of species tree estimation methods that are specifically designed to address gene tree discordance. In this article, we report on a study to evaluate MP-EST-one of the most popular species tree estimation methods designed to address ILS-as well as concatenation under maximum likelihood, the greedy consensus, and two supertree methods (Matrix Representation with Parsimony and Matrix Representation with Likelihood). Our study shows that several factors impact the absolute and relative accuracy of methods, including the number of gene trees, the accuracy of the estimated gene trees, and the amount of ILS. Concatenation can be more accurate than the best summary methods in some cases (mostly when the gene trees have poor phylogenetic signal or when the level of ILS is low), but summary methods are generally more accurate than concatenation when there are an adequate number of sufficiently accurate gene trees. Our study suggests that coalescent-based species tree methods may be key to estimating highly accurate species trees from multiple loci.},

	abstract = {There is a lack of consensus on how next-generation sequence data should be considered for phylogenetic and phylogeographic estimates, with some studies excluding loci with missing data, while others include them, even when sequences are missing from a large number of individuals. Here we use simulations, focusing specifically on RAD sequences, to highlight some of the unforeseen consequence of excluding missing data from next-generation sequencing. Specifically, we show that in addition to the obvious effects associated with reducing the amount of data used to make historical inferences, the decisions we make about missing data (such as the minimum number of individuals with a sequence for a locus to be included in the study) also impact the types of loci sampled for a study. In particular, as the tolerance for missing data becomes more stringent, the mutational spectrum represented in the sampled loci becomes truncated such that loci with the highest mutation rates are disproportionately excluded. This effect is exacerbated further by factors involved in the preparation of the genomic library (i.e., the use of reduced representation libraries, as well as the coverage) and the taxonomic diversity represented in the library (i.e., the level of divergence among the individuals). We demonstrate that the intuitive appeals about being conservative by removing loci may be misguided.},

We examine several computationally efficient approaches-MP-EST, STAR, STEAC, STELLS, and STEM-for inferring species trees from gene trees estimated using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian approaches. Among the methods examined, we found that topology-based methods often performed better using ML gene trees and methods employing coalescent times typically performed better using Bayesian gene trees, with MP-EST, STAR, STEAC, and STELLS outperforming STEM under most conditions. We examine why the STEM tree (also called GLASS or Maximum Tree) is less accurate on estimated gene trees by comparing estimated and true coalescence times, performing species tree inference using simulations, and analyzing a great ape data set keeping track of false positive and false negative rates for inferred clades. We find that although true coalescence times are more ancient than speciation times under the multispecies coalescent model, estimated coalescence times are often more recent than speciation times. This underestimation can lead to increased bias and lack of resolution with increased sampling (either alleles or loci) when gene trees are estimated with ML. The problem appears to be less severe using Bayesian gene-tree estimates.

	abstract = {The Minimum Evolution (ME) approach to phylogeny estimation has been shown to be statistically consistent when it is used in conjunction with ordinary least-squares (OLS) fitting of a metric to a tree structure. The traditional approach to using ME has been to start with the Neighbor Joining (NJ) topology for a given matrix and then do a topological search from that starting point. The first stage requires O(n(3)) time, where n is the number of taxa, while the current implementations of the second are in O(p n(3)) or more, where p is the number of swaps performed by the program. In this paper, we examine a greedy approach to minimum evolution which produces a starting topology in O(n(2)) time. Moreover, we provide an algorithm that searches for the best topology using nearest neighbor interchanges (NNIs), where the cost of doing p NNIs is O(n(2) + p n), i.e., O(n(2)) in practice because p is always much smaller than n. The Greedy Minimum Evolution (GME) algorithm, when used in combination with NNIs, produces trees which are fairly close to NJ trees in terms of topological accuracy. We also examine ME under a balanced weighting scheme, where sibling subtrees have equal weight, as opposed to the standard "unweighted" OLS, where all taxa have the same weight so that the weight of a subtree is equal to the number of its taxa. The balanced minimum evolution scheme (BME) runs slower than the OLS version, requiring O(n(2) x diam(T)) operations to build the starting tree and O(p n x diam(T)) to perform the NNIs, where diam(T) is the topological diameter of the output tree. In the usual Yule-Harding distribution on phylogenetic trees, the diameter expectation is in log(n), so our algorithms are in practice faster that NJ. Moreover, this BME scheme yields a very significant improvement over NJ and other distance-based algorithms, especially with large trees, in terms of topological accuracy.},

We are convinced that the sole prospect for a sustainable identification capability lies in the construction of systems that employ DNA sequences as taxon 'barcodes'. We establish that the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) can serve as the core of a global bioidentification system for animals. First, we demonstrate that COI profiles, derived from the low-density sampling of higher taxonomic categories, ordinarily assign newly analysed taxa to the appropriate phylum or order. Second, we demonstrate that species-level assignments can be obtained by creating comprehensive COI profiles. A model COI profile, based upon the analysis of a single individual from each of 200 closely allied species of lepidopterans, was 100\% successful in correctly identifying subsequent specimens. When fully developed, a COI identification system will provide a reliable, cost-effective and accessible solution to the current problem of species identification. Its assembly will also generate important new insights into the diversification of life and the rules of molecular evolution.},

This study began with an examination of patterns of sequence divergences in this gene region for 38 fungal taxa with full CO1 sequences. Because these results suggested that CO1 could be effective in species recognition, we designed primers for a 545-bp fragment of CO1 and generated sequences for multiple strains from 58 species of Penicillium subgenus Penicillium and 12 allied species. Despite the frequent literature reports of introns in fungal mitochondrial genomes, we detected introns in only 2 of 370 Penicillium strains. Representatives from 38 of 58 species formed cohesive assemblages with distinct CO1 sequences, and all cases of sequence sharing involved known species complexes. CO1 sequence divergences averaged 0.06\% within species, less than for internal transcribed spacer nrDNA or beta-tubulin sequences (BenA). CO1 divergences between species averaged 5.6\%, comparable to internal transcribed spacer, but less than values for BenA (14.4\%). Although the latter gene delivered higher taxonomic resolution, the amplification and alignment of CO1 was simpler. The development of a barcoding system for fungi that shares a common gene target with other kingdoms would be a significant advance.},

Of approximately 84 currently recognized Ichneumonoidea subfamilies, 2500 genera and 41,000 described species, barcoding 5'-COI data were assembled for 4168 putative species-level terminals (many undescribed), representing 671 genera and all but ten of the currently recognized subfamilies. After the removal of identical and near-identical sequences, the 4174 initial sequences were reduced to 3278. We show that when subjected to phylogenetic analysis using both maximum likelihood and parsimony, there is a broad correlation between taxonomic congruence and number of included sequences. We additionally present a new measure of taxonomic congruence based upon the Simpson diversity index, the Simpson dominance index, which gives greater weight to morphologically recognized taxonomic groups (subfamilies) recovered with most representatives in one or a few contiguous groups or subclusters.},

This method, UniFrac, measures the phylogenetic distance between sets of taxa in a phylogenetic tree as the fraction of the branch length of the tree that leads to descendants from either one environment or the other, but not both. UniFrac can be used to determine whether communities are signifi- cantly different, to compare many communities simultaneously using clustering and ordination techniques, and to measure the relative contributions of different factors, such as chemistry and geography, to similarities between samples. We demonstrate the utility of UniFrac by applying it to published 16S rRNA gene libraries from cultured isolates and environmental clones of bacteria in marine sediment, water, and ice. Our results reveal that (i) cultured isolates from ice, water, and sediment resemble each other and environmental clone sequences from sea ice, but not environmental clone sequences from sediment and water; (ii) the geographical location does not correlate strongly with bacterial community differences in ice and sediment from the Arctic and Antarctic; and (iii) bacterial communities differ between terrestrially impacted seawater (whether polar or temperate) and warm oligotrophic seawater, whereas those in individual seawater samples are not more similar to each other than to those in sediment or ice samples. These results illustrate that UniFrac provides a new way of characterizing microbial communities, using the wealth of environmental rRNA sequences, and allows quantitative insight into the factors that underlie the distribution of lineages among environments.},

	abstract = {The origin of land plants is a fundamental topic in plant evolutionary biology. Despite the crucial importance for knowing the closest lineages of land plants, this question has not been fully answered yet. Using recently available nuclear sequences from streptophyte algae, the multispecies coalescent model produces a congruent phylogeny that is robust to different data sets, in contrast to the conflicting phylogenies produced by the concatenation method. Using phylogenomic data and the coalescent model, in this opinion article we postulate that the Zygnematales are the closest lineages of land plants. We suggest that the coalescent model can accommodate gene tree heterogeneity in deep-level phylogenies and can be potentially used to resolve other deep species phylogenies.},

However, its biological basis eludes many 21st century practitioners. A path from the 19th century recognition of the informational basis of heredity to the modern era can be discerned. Crick’s DNA ‘unpairing postulate’ predicted that recombinational pairing of homologous DNAs during meiosis would be mediated by short k-mers in the loops of stem-loop structures extruded from classical duplex helices. The complementary ‘kissing’ duplex loops – like tRNA anticodon–codon k-mer duplexes – would seed a more extensive pairing that would then extend until limited by lack of homology or other factors. Indeed, this became the principle behind alignment-based methods that assessed similarity by degree of DNA–DNA reassociation in vitro. These are now seen as less sensitive than alignment-free methods that are closely consistent, both theoretically and mechanistically, with chromosomal anti-recombination models for the initiation of divergence into new species. The analytical power of k-mer differences supports the theses that evolutionary advance sometimes serves the needs of nucleic acids (genomes) rather than proteins (genes), and that such differences can play a role in early speciation events.},

Sequencing has the ability to capture all the DNA or RNA from pathogenic organisms in a human sample. However, complete and accurate characterization of the sequence, including identification of any pathogens, depends on the availability and quality of genomes for comparison. Thousands of genomes are now available, and as these numbers grow, the power of metagenomic sequencing for diagnosis should increase. However, recent studies have exposed the presence of contamination in published genomes, which when used for diagnosis increases the risk of falsely identifying the wrong pathogen. To address this problem, we have developed a bioinformatics system for eliminating contamination as well as low-complexity genomic sequences in the draft genomes of eukaryotic pathogens. We applied this software to identify and remove human, bacterial, archaeal, and viral sequences present in a comprehensive database of all sequenced eukaryotic pathogen genomes. We also removed low-complexity genomic sequences, another source of false positives. Using this pipeline, we have produced a database of "clean" eukaryotic pathogen genomes for use with bioinformatics classification and analysis tools. We demonstrate that when attempting to find eukaryotic pathogens in metagenomic samples, the new database provides better sensitivity than one using the original genomes while offering a dramatic reduction in false positives.},

Felsenstein suggested that bootstrapping be applied across characters of a taxon-by-character data matrix to produce replicate "bootstrap data sets," each of which is then analyzed phylogenetically, with a consensus tree constructed to summarize the results of all replicates. The proportion of trees/replicates in which a grouping is recovered is presented as a measure of support for that group. Bootstrapping has become a common feature of phylogenetic analysis. However, the interpretation of bootstrap values remains open to discussion, and phylogeneticists have used these values in multiple ways. The usefulness of phylogenetic bootstrapping is potentially limited by a number of features, such as the size of the data matrix and the underlying assumptions of the phylogeny reconstruction program. Recent studies have explored the application of bootstrapping to large data sets and the relative performance of bootstrapping and jackknifing.]},

	abstract = {Taxonomic classification is at the core of environmental DNA analysis. When a phylogenetic tree can be built as a prior hypothesis to such classification, phylogenetic placement (PP) provides the most informative type of classification because each query sequence is assigned to its putative origin in the tree. This is useful whenever precision is sought (e.g. in diagnostics). However, likelihood-based PP algorithms struggle to scale with the ever-increasing throughput of DNA sequencing. We have developed RAPPAS (Rapid Alignment-free Phylogenetic Placement via Ancestral Sequences) which uses an alignment-free approach, removing the hurdle of query sequence alignment as a preliminary step to PP. Our approach relies on the precomputation of a database of k-mers that may be present with non-negligible probability in relatives of the reference sequences. The placement is performed by inspecting the stored phylogenetic origins of the k-mers in the query, and their probabilities. The database can be reused for the analysis of several different metagenomes. Experiments show that the first implementation of RAPPAS is already faster than competing likelihood-based PP algorithms, while keeping similar accuracy for short reads. RAPPAS scales PP for the era of routine metagenomic diagnostics.Program and sources freely available for download at https://github.com/blinard-BIOINFO/RAPPAS.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

To this end, summary methods have been developed to allow accurate and scalable inference of species trees from gene trees. However, most of these methods, including the widely used ASTRAL, can only handle single-copy gene trees and do not attempt to model gene duplication and gene loss. As a result, most phylogenomic studies have focused on single-copy genes and have discarded large parts of the data. Here, we first propose a measure of quartet similarity between single-copy and multicopy trees that accounts for orthology and paralogy. We then introduce a method called ASTRAL-Pro (ASTRAL for PaRalogs and Orthologs) to find the species tree that optimizes our quartet similarity measure using dynamic programing. By studying its performance on an extensive collection of simulated data sets and on real data sets, we show that ASTRAL-Pro is more accurate than alternative methods.},

Public health intervention, such as ensuring people living with HIV adhere to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and are continually virally-suppressed, can help control the spread of the virus. However, such intervention requires utilizing the limited public health resource allocations. As a result, the ability to determine which individuals are most at-risk of transmitting HIV could allow public health officials to focus their limited resources on these individuals. Molecular epidemiology suggests an approach: prioritizing people living with HIV based on patterns of transmission inferred from their sampled viral sequences. In this paper, we introduce ProACT (Prioritization using AnCesTral edge lengths), a phylogenetic approach for prioritizing individuals living with HIV. ProACT uses a simple idea: ordering individuals by their terminal branch length in the phylogeny of their virus. In simulations and also on a dataset of HIV-1 subtype B pol sequences obtained in San Diego, we show that this simple strategy improves the effectiveness of prioritization compared to state-of-the-art methods that rely on monitoring the growth of transmission clusters defined based on genetic distance.},

Species delimitation is closely related to species tree inference from discordant gene trees, a problem that has enjoyed rapid advances in recent years. A major advance has been the surprising accuracy and scalability of methods that rely on breaking gene trees into quartets of leaves. In this paper, we build on this success and propose a new method called SODA for species delimitation.

	abstract = {The ability to detect the identity of a sample obtained from its environment is a cornerstone of molecular ecological research. Thanks to the falling price of shotgun sequencing, genome skimming, the acquisition of short reads spread across the genome at low coverage, is emerging as an alternative to traditional barcoding. By obtaining far more data across the whole genome, skimming has the promise to increase the precision of sample identification beyond traditional barcoding while keeping the costs manageable. While methods for assembly-free sample identification based on genome skims are now available, little is known about how these methods react to the presence of DNA from organisms other than the target species. In this paper, we show that the accuracy of distances computed between a pair of genome skims based on k-mer similarity can degrade dramatically if the skims include contaminant reads; i.e., any reads originating from other organisms. We establish a theoretical model of the impact of contamination. We then suggest and evaluate a solution to the contamination problem: Query reads in a genome skim against an extensive database of possible contaminants (e.g., all microbial organisms) and filter out any read that matches. We evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy when implemented using Kraken-II, in detailed analyses. Our results show substantial improvements in accuracy as a result of filtering but also point to limitations, including a need for relatively close matches in the contaminant database.},

	abstract = {K-mer based methods have become prevalent in many areas of bioinformatics. In applications such as database search, they often work with large multi-terabyte-sized datasets. Storing such large datasets is a detriment to tool developers, tool users, and reproducibility efforts. General purpose compressors like gzip, or those designed for read data, are sub-optimal because they do not take into account the specific redundancy pattern in k-mer sets. In our earlier work (Rahman and Medvedev, RECOMB 2020), we presented an algorithm UST-Compress that uses a spectrum-preserving string set representation to compress a set of k-mers to disk. In this paper, we present two improved methods for disk compression of k-mer sets, called ESS-Compress and ESS-Tip-Compress. They use a more relaxed notion of string set representation to further remove redundancy from the representation of UST-Compress. We explore their behavior both theoretically and on real data. We show that they improve the compression sizes achieved by UST-Compress by up to 27 percent, across a breadth of datasets. We also derive lower bounds on how well this type of compression strategy can hope to do.},

However, despite the numerous quartet-based methods that have been developed, their performance in simulation has been disappointing. In particular, Ranwez and Gascuel, the developers of one of the best quartet methods, conjecture that quartet-based methods have inherent limitations that make them unable to produce trees as accurate as neighbor joining or maximum parsimony. In this paper, we present Short Quartet Puzzling, a new quartet-based phylogeny reconstruction algorithm, and we demonstrate the improved topological accuracy of the new method over maximum parsimony and neighbor joining, disproving the conjecture of Ranwez and Gascuel. We also show a dramatic improvement over Quartet Puzzling. Thus, while our new method is not compared to any ML method (as it is not expected to be as accurate as the best of these), this study shows that quartet methods are not as limited in performance as was previously conjectured, and opens the possibility to further improvements through new algorithmic designs.},

We show that existing phylogenetic methods that treat each gene tree in isolation show large-scale inaccuracies, largely due to insufficient phylogenetic information in individual genes. However, we find that gene trees exhibit common properties that can be exploited for evolutionary studies and accurate phylogenetic reconstruction. Evolutionary rates can be decoupled into gene-specific and species-specific components, which can be learned across complete genomes. We develop a phylogenetic reconstruction methodology that exploits these properties and achieves significantly higher accuracy, addressing the species-level heterotachy and enabling studies of gene evolution in the context of species evolution.},

The potential for discordance between the gene trees has motivated the development of summary methods that reconstruct a species tree from an input collection of gene trees. ASTRAL is a widely used summary method and has been able to scale to relatively large datasets. However, the size of genomic datasets is quickly growing. Despite its relative efficiency, the current single-threaded implementation of ASTRAL is falling behind the data growth trends is not able to analyze the largest available datasets in a reasonable time. Results: ASTRAL uses dynamic programing and is not trivially parallel. In this paper, we introduce ASTRAL-MP, the first version of ASTRAL that can exploit parallelism and also uses randomization techniques to speed up some of its steps. Importantly, ASTRAL-MP can take advantage of not just multiple CPU cores but also one or several graphics processing units (GPUs). The ASTRAL-MP code scales very well with increasing CPU cores, and its GPU version, implemented in OpenCL, can have up to 158× speedups compared to ASTRAL-III. Using GPUs and multiple cores, ASTRAL-MP is able to analyze datasets with 10 000 species or datasets with more than 100 000 genes in {\textless}2 days.

A limiting factor in these studies has been the identification and screening of orthologous loci across an evolutionarily distant set of taxa. Here, we evaluate the efficacy of genomic markers targeting ultraconserved DNA elements (UCEs) for analyses at shallow evolutionary timescales. Using sequence capture and massively parallel sequencing to generate UCE data for five co-distributed Neotropical rainforest bird species, we recovered 776-1516 UCE loci across the five species. Across species, 53-77\% of the loci were polymorphic, containing between 2.0 and 3.2 variable sites per polymorphic locus, on average. We performed species tree construction, coalescent modeling, and species delimitation, and we found that the five co-distributed species exhibited discordant phylogeographic histories. We also found that species trees and divergence times estimated from UCEs were similar to the parameters obtained from mtDNA. The species that inhabit the understory had older divergence times across barriers, contained a higher number of cryptic species, and exhibited larger effective population sizes relative to the species inhabiting the canopy. Because orthologous UCEs can be obtained from a wide array of taxa, are polymorphic at shallow evolutionary timescales, and can be generated rapidly at low cost, they are an effective genetic marker for studies investigating evolutionary patterns and processes at shallow timescales.},

However, because the viral phylogeny is already so large-and will undoubtedly grow many fold-placing new sequences onto the tree has emerged as a barrier to real-time genomic contact tracing. Here, we resolve this challenge by building an efficient, tree-based data structure encoding the inferred evolutionary history of the virus. We demonstrate that our approach improves the speed of phylogenetic placement of new samples and data visualization by orders of magnitude, making it possible to complete the placements under real-time constraints. Our method also provides the key ingredient for maintaining a fully-updated reference phylogeny. We make these tools available to the research community through the UCSC SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser to enable rapid cross-referencing of information in new virus sequences with an ever-expanding array of molecular and structural biology data.

The proposed method is ductile and can be tailored to return either linear or non-linear classifiers. Adjusting the eigenvalues, when freezing the eigenvectors entries, yields performances that are superior to those attained with standard methods restricted to operate with an identical number of free parameters. To recover a feed-forward architecture in direct space, we have postulated a nested indentation of the eigenvectors.

However, although the higher-level relationships among cetacean families have been largely settled, several aspects of the systematics within these groups remain unresolved. Problematic clades include the oceanic dolphins (37 spp.), which have experienced a recent rapid radiation, and the beaked whales (22 spp.), which have not been investigated in detail using nuclear loci. The combined application of high-throughput sequencing with techniques that target specific genomic sequences provide a powerful means of rapidly generating large volumes of orthologous sequence data for use in phylogenomic studies. To elucidate the phylogenetic relationships within the Cetacea, we combined sequence capture with Illumina sequencing to generate data for \${\textbackslash}sim \$3200 protein-coding genes for 68 cetacean species and their close relatives including the pygmy hippopotamus. By combining data from \$\&gt;\$38,000 exons with existing sequences from 11 cetaceans and seven outgroup taxa, we produced the first comprehensive comparative genomic data set for cetaceans, spanning 6,527,596 aligned base pairs (bp) and 89 taxa. Phylogenetic trees reconstructed with maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference of concatenated loci, as well as with coalescence analyses of individual gene trees, produced mostly concordant and well-supported trees. Our results completely resolve the relationships among beaked whales as well as the contentious relationships among oceanic dolphins, especially the problematic subfamily Delphinidae. We carried out Bayesian estimation of species divergence times using MCMCTree and compared our complete data set to a subset of clocklike genes. Analyses using the complete data set consistently showed less variance in divergence times than the reduced data set. In addition, integration of new fossils (e.g., Mystacodon selenensis) indicates that the diversification of Crown Cetacea began before the Late Eocene and the divergence of Crown Delphinidae as early as the Middle Miocene.

Recent advances in microelectronics and battery technology have resulted in the rapid development of low-cost UASs that are transforming many industries. Drones are poised to revolutionize marine science and conservation, as they provide essentially on-demand remote sensing capabilities at low cost and with reduced human risk. A variety of multirotor, fixed-wing, and transitional UAS platforms are capable of carrying various optical and physical sampling payloads and are being employed in almost every subdiscipline of marine science and conservation. This article provides an overview of the UAS platforms and sensors used in marine science and conservation missions along with example physical, biological, and natural resource management applications and typical analytical workflows. It concludes with details on potential effects of UASs on marine wildlife and a look to the future of UASs in marine science and conservation.},

	abstract = {The advent of next generation sequencing technologies has made whole-genome and whole-population sampling possible, even for eukaryotes with large genomes. With this development, experimental evolution studies can be designed to observe molecular evolution “in action” via evolve-and-resequence (E\&R) experiments. Among other applications, E\&R studies can be used to locate the genes and variants responsible for genetic adaptation. Most existing literature on time-series data analysis often assumes large population size, accurate allele frequency estimates, or wide time spans. These assumptions do not hold in many E\&R studies. In this article, we propose a method—composition of likelihoods for evolve-and-resequence experiments (Clear)—to identify signatures of selection in small population E\&R experiments. Clear takes whole-genome sequences of pools of individuals as input, and properly addresses heterogeneous ascertainment bias resulting from uneven coverage. Clear also provides unbiased estimates of model parameters, including population size, selection strength, and dominance, while being computationally efficient. Extensive simulations show that Clear achieves higher power in detecting and localizing selection over a wide range of parameters, and is robust to variation of coverage. We applied the Clear statistic to multiple E\&R experiments, including data from a study of adaptation of Drosophila melanogaster to alternating temperatures and a study of outcrossing yeast populations, and identified multiple regions under selection with genome-wide significance.},

Of the 22 eVNTRs in blood where independent data is available, 21 (95\%) are replicated in terms of significance and direction of association. 49\% of the eVNTR loci show a strong and likely causal impact on the expression of genes and 80\% have maximum effect size at least 0.3.

While different samples can be separated post sequencing using sample barcodes, the possibility of cross contamination between biological samples from different species that have been processed or sequenced in parallel has the potential to be extremely deleterious for downstream analyses. RESULTS We present CroCo, a software package for identifying and removing such cross contaminants from assembled transcriptomes. Using multiple, recently published sequence datasets, we show that cross contamination is consistently present at varying levels in real data. Using real and simulated data, we demonstrate that CroCo detects contaminants efficiently and correctly. Using a real example from a molecular phylogenetic dataset, we show that contaminants, if not eliminated, can have a decisive, deleterious impact on downstream comparative analyses. CONCLUSIONS Cross contamination is pervasive in new and published datasets and, if undetected, can have serious deleterious effects on downstream analyses. CroCo is a database-independent, multi-platform tool, designed for ease of use, that efficiently and accurately detects and removes cross contamination in assembled transcriptomes to avoid these problems. We suggest that the use of CroCo should become a standard cleaning step when processing multiple samples for transcriptome sequencing.},

The inferred duplication-loss histories provide valuable information for a broad range of biological applications, including ortholog identification, estimating gene duplication times, and rooting and correcting gene trees. While reconciliation for binary trees is a tractable and well studied problem, there are no algorithms for reconciliation with non-binary species trees. Yet a striking proportion of species trees are non-binary. For example, 64\% of branch points in the NCBI taxonomy have three or more children. When applied to non-binary species trees, current algorithms overestimate the number of duplications because they cannot distinguish between duplication and incomplete lineage sorting. We present the first algorithms for reconciling binary gene trees with non-binary species trees under a duplication-loss parsimony model. Our algorithms utilize an efficient mapping from gene to species trees to infer the minimum number of duplications in O({\textbar}V(G) {\textbar} x (k(S) + h(S))) time, where {\textbar}V(G){\textbar} is the number of nodes in the gene tree, h(S) is the height of the species tree and k(S) is the size of its largest polytomy. We present a dynamic programming algorithm which also minimizes the total number of losses. Although this algorithm is exponential in the size of the largest polytomy, it performs well in practice for polytomies with outdegree of 12 or less. We also present a heuristic which estimates the minimal number of losses in polynomial time. In empirical tests, this algorithm finds an optimal loss history 99\% of the time. Our algorithms have been implemented in NOTUNG, a robust, production quality, tree-fitting program, which provides a graphical user interface for exploratory analysis and also supports automated, high-throughput analysis of large data sets.},

	abstract = {Whole-genome duplications (WGDs) have major impacts on the evolution of species, as they produce new gene copies contributing substantially to adaptation, isolation, phenotypic robustness, and evolvability. They result in large, complex gene families with recurrent gene losses in descendant species that sequence-based phylogenetic methods fail to reconstruct accurately. As a result, orthologs and paralogs are difficult to identify reliably in WGD-descended species, which hinders the exploration of functional consequences of WGDs. Here, we present Synteny-guided CORrection of Paralogies and Orthologies (SCORPiOs), a novel method to reconstruct gene phylogenies in the context of a known WGD event. WGDs generate large duplicated syntenic regions, which SCORPiOs systematically leverages as a complement to sequence evolution to infer the evolutionary history of genes. We applied SCORPiOs to the 320-My-old WGD at the origin of teleost fish. We find that almost one in four teleost gene phylogenies in the Ensembl database (3,394) are inconsistent with their syntenic contexts. For 70\% of these gene families (2,387), we were able to propose an improved phylogenetic tree consistent with both the molecular substitution distances and the local syntenic information. We show that these synteny-guided phylogenies are more congruent with the species tree, with sequence evolution and with expected expression conservation patterns than those produced by state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we show that synteny-guided gene trees emphasize contributions of WGD paralogs to evolutionary innovations in the teleost clade.},

Here, as part of the One Thousand Plant Transcriptomes Initiative, we sequenced the vegetative transcriptomes of 1,124 species that span the diversity of plants in a broad sense (Archaeplastida), including green plants (Viridiplantae), glaucophytes (Glaucophyta) and red algae (Rhodophyta). Our analysis provides a robust phylogenomic framework for examining the evolution of green plants. Most inferred species relationships are well supported across multiple species tree and supermatrix analyses, but discordance among plastid and nuclear gene trees at a few important nodes highlights the complexity of plant genome evolution, including polyploidy, periods of rapid speciation, and extinction. Incomplete sorting of ancestral variation, polyploidization and massive expansions of gene families punctuate the evolutionary history of green plants. Notably, we find that large expansions of gene families preceded the origins of green plants, land plants and vascular plants, whereas whole-genome duplications are inferred to have occurred repeatedly throughout the evolution of flowering plants and ferns. The increasing availability of high-quality plant genome sequences and advances in functional genomics are enabling research on genome evolution across the green tree of life.},

	abstract = {Phylogeny estimation is a major step in many biological studies, and has many well known challenges. With the dropping cost of sequencing technologies, biologists now have increasingly large datasets available for use in phylogeny estimation. Here we address the challenge of estimating a tree given large datasets with a combination of full-length sequences and fragmentary sequences, which can arise due to a variety of reasons, including sample collection, sequencing technologies, and analytical pipelines. We compare two basic approaches: (1) computing an alignment on the full dataset and then computing a maximum likelihood tree on the alignment, or (2) constructing an alignment and tree on the full length sequences and then using phylogenetic placement to add the remaining sequences (which will generally be fragmentary) into the tree. We explore these two approaches on a range of simulated datasets, each with 1000 sequences and varying in rates of evolution, and two biological datasets. Our study shows some striking performance differences between methods, especially when there is substantial sequence length heterogeneity and high rates of evolution. We find in particular that using UPP to align sequences and RAxML to compute a tree on the alignment provides the best accuracy, substantially outperforming trees computed using phylogenetic placement methods. We also find that FastTree has poor accuracy on alignments containing fragmentary sequences. Overall, our study provides insights into the literature comparing different methods and pipelines for phylogenetic estimation, and suggests directions for future method development.

In this paper, I review the current standpoint on horizontal gene transfer in evolutionary thinking and discuss how important horizontal gene transfer is in evolution in the broad sense, and particularly in prokaryotic evolution. I review recent literature, asking, first, which processes are involved in the evolutionary success of transferred genes and, secondly, about the extent of horizontal gene transfer towards different evolutionary times. Moreover, I discuss the feasibility of reconstructing ancient phylogenetic relationships in the face of horizontal gene transfer. Finally, I discuss how horizontal gene transfer fits in the current neo-Darwinian evolutionary paradigm and conclude there is a need for a new evolutionary paradigm that includes horizontal gene transfer as well as other mechanisms in the explanation of evolution.},

RESULTS: A method is presented to shift computational costs to an off-line computation by creating a taxonomy/genome index that supports scalable metagenomic classification. Scalable performance is demonstrated on real and simulated data to show accurate classification in the presence of novel organisms on samples that include viruses, prokaryotes, fungi and protists.},

Recently, the deep sequence coverage generated by next-generation sequencing technologies has caused the amount of sequence to be processed during a genome project to grow rapidly, and has rendered current k-mer counting tools too slow and memory intensive. At the same time, large multicore computers have become commonplace in research facilities allowing for a new parallel computational paradigm.Results: We propose a new k-mer counting algorithm and associated implementation, called Jellyfish, which is fast and memory efficient. It is based on a multithreaded, lock-free hash table optimized for counting k-mers up to 31 bases in length. Due to their flexibility, suffix arrays have been the data structure of choice for solving many string problems. For the task of k-mer counting, important in many biological applications, Jellyfish offers a much faster and more memory-efficient solution.Availability: The Jellyfish software is written in C++ and is GPL licensed.

	abstract = {Merging paired-end shotgun reads generated on high-throughput sequencing platforms can substantially improve various subsequent bioinformatics processes, including genome assembly, binning, mapping, annotation, and clustering for taxonomic analysis. With the inexorable growth of sequence data volume and CPU core counts, the speed and scalability of read-processing tools becomes ever-more important. The accuracy of shotgun read merging is crucial as well, as errors introduced by incorrect merging percolate through to reduce the quality of downstream analysis. Thus, we designed a new tool to maximize accuracy and minimize processing time, allowing the use of read merging on larger datasets, and in analyses highly sensitive to errors. We present BBMerge, a new merging tool for paired-end shotgun sequence data. We benchmark BBMerge by comparison with eight other widely used merging tools, assessing speed, accuracy and scalability. Evaluations of both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BBMerge produces merged shotgun reads with greater accuracy and at higher speed than any existing merging tool examined. BBMerge also provides the ability to merge non-overlapping shotgun read pairs by using k-mer frequency information to assemble the unsequenced gap between reads, achieving a significantly higher merge rate while maintaining or increasing accuracy.},

In the absence of robust observational data for these species, genetic data can aid inferences on population connectivity, demography and ecology. A previous investigation of genetic diversity and population structure in Gray's beaked whale ( Mesoplodon grayi ) from Western Australia and New Zealand found high levels of mtDNA diversity, no geographic structure and stable demographic history. To further investigate phylogeographic and demographic patterns across their range, we generated complete mitochondrial and partial nuclear genomes of 16 of the individuals previously analysed and included additional samples from South Africa ( n = 2) and South Australia ( n = 4), greatly expanding the spatial range of genomic data for the species. Gray's beaked whales are highly elusive and rarely observed, and our data represents a unique and geographically broad dataset. We find relatively high levels of diversity in the mitochondrial genome, despite an absence of population structure at the mitochondrial and nuclear level. Demographic analyses suggest these whales existed at stable levels over at least the past 1.1 million years, with an approximately twofold increase in female effective population size approximately 250 thousand years ago, coinciding with a period of increased Southern Ocean productivity, sea surface temperature and a potential expansion of suitable habitat. Our results suggest that Gray's beaked whales are likely to be resilient to near-future ecosystem changes, facilitating their conservation.

Here, we introduce ClipKIT, an alignment trimming software that, rather than identifying and removing putatively phylogenetically uninformative sites, instead aims to identify and retain parsimony-informative sites, which are known to be phylogenetically informative. To test the efficacy of ClipKIT, we examined the accuracy and support of phylogenies inferred from 14 different alignment trimming strategies, including those implemented in ClipKIT, across nearly 140,000 alignments from a broad sampling of evolutionary histories. Phylogenies inferred from ClipKIT-trimmed alignments are accurate, robust, and time saving. Furthermore, ClipKIT consistently outperformed other trimming methods across diverse datasets, suggesting that strategies based on identifying and retaining parsimony-informative sites provide a robust framework for alignment trimming.},

However, of the half-dozen such methods proposed over the last few years, only two fulfill this condition without requiring knowledge of typically unknown parameters, such as the evolutionary rate(s) used in the model; this additional requirement severely limits the applicability of the methods. We say that methods that need such knowledge demonstrate relative fast convergence, since they rely upon an oracle. We focus on the class of methods that do not require such knowledge and thus demonstrate absolute fast convergence. We give a very general construction scheme that not only turns any relative fast-converging method into an absolute fast-converging one, but also turns any statistically consistent method that converges from sequence of length \&Ogr;(e \&Ogr;(diam(T))) into an absolute fast-converging method.

Results: We report here on our successful efforts to scale up direct optimization through a two-step approach: the first step decomposes the dataset into smaller pieces and runs the direct optimization (GRAPPA) on the smaller pieces, while the second step builds a tree from the results obtained on the smaller pieces.We used the sophisticated disk-covering method (DCM) pioneered by Warnow and her group, suitably modified to take into account the computational limitations of GRAPPA. We find that DCM- GRAPPA scales gracefully to at least 1000 genomes of afew hundred genes each and retains surprisingly high accuracy throughout the range: in our experiments, the topological error rate rarely exceeded a few percent. Thus, reconstruction based on gene-order data can now be accomplished with high accuracy on datasets of significant size.

	abstract = {Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is ubiquitous in evolution and bioinformatics. MSAs are usually taken to be a known and fixed quantity on which to perform downstream analysis despite extensive evidence that MSA accuracy and uncertainty affect results. These errors are known to cause a wide range of problems for downstream evolutionary inference, ranging from false inference of positive selection to long branch attraction artifacts. The most popular approach to dealing with this problem is to remove (filter) specific columns in the MSA that are thought to be prone to error. Although popular, this approach has had mixed success and several studies have even suggested that filtering might be detrimental to phylogenetic studies. We present a graph-based clustering method to address MSA uncertainty and error in the software Divvier (available at https://github.com/simonwhelan/Divvier), which uses a probabilistic model to identify clusters of characters that have strong statistical evidence of shared homology. These clusters can then be used to either filter characters from the MSA (partial filtering) or represent each of the clusters in a new column (divvying). We validate Divvier through its performance on real and simulated benchmarks, finding Divvier substantially outperforms existing filtering software by retaining more true pairwise homologies calls and removing more false positive pairwise homologies. We also find that Divvier, in contrast to other filtering tools, can alleviate long branch attraction artifacts induced by MSA and reduces the variation in tree estimates caused by MSA uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Genetic tools are increasingly used to identify and discriminate between species. One key transition in this process was the recognition of the potential of the ca 658bp fragment of the organelle cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) as a barcode region, which revolutionized animal bioidentification and lead, among others, to the instigation of the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD), containing currently barcodes from {\textgreater}7.9 million specimens. Following this discovery, suggestions for other organellar regions and markers, and the primers with which to amplify them, have been continuously proposed. Most recently, the field has taken the leap from PCR‐based generation of DNA references into shotgun sequencing‐based “genome skimming” alternatives, with the ultimate goal of assembling organellar reference genomes. Unfortunately, in genome skimming approaches, much of the nuclear genome (as much as 99\% of the sequence data) is discarded, which is not only wasteful, but can also limit the power of discrimination at, or below, the species level. Here, we advocate that the full shotgun sequence data can be used to assign an identity (that we term for convenience its “DNA‐mark”) for both voucher and query samples, without requiring any computationally intensive pretreatment (e.g. assembly) of reads. We argue that if reference databases are populated with such “DNA‐marks,” it will enable future DNA‐based taxonomic identification to complement, or even replace PCR of barcodes with genome skimming, and we discuss how such methodology ultimately could enable identification to population, or even individual, level.},

	abstract = {Let Rn denote the set of rooted trees with n leaves in which: the leaves are labeled by the integers in \{1, ..., n\}; and among interior vertices only the root may have degree two. Associated with each interior vertex v in such a tree is the subset, or cluster, of leaf labels in the subtree rooted at v. Cluster \{1, ..., n\} is called trivial. Clusters are used in quantitative measures of similarity, dissimilarity and consensus among trees. For any k trees in Rn, the strict consensus tree C(T1, ..., Tk) is that tree in Rn containing exactly those clusters common to every one of the k trees. Similarity between trees T1 and T2 in Rn is measured by the number S(T1, T2) of nontrivial clusters in both T1 and T2; dissimilarity, by the number D(T1, T2) of clusters in T1 or T2 but not in both. Algorithms are known to compute C(T1, ..., Tk) in O(kn2) time, and S(T1, T2) and D(T1, T2) in O(n2) time. I propose a special representation of the clusters of any tree T Rn, one that permits testing in constant time whether a given cluster exists in T. I describe algorithms that exploit this representation to compute C(T1, ..., Tk) in O(kn) time, and S(T1, T2) and D(T1, T2) in O(n) time. These algorithms are optimal in a technical sense. They enable well-known indices of consensus between two trees to be computed in O(n) time. All these results apply as well to comparable problems involving unrooted trees with labeled leaves. © 1985 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Clustering homologous sequences based on their similarity is a problem that appears in many bioinformatics applications. The fact that sequences cluster is ultimately the result of their phylogenetic relationships. Despite this observation and the natural ways in which a tree can define clusters, most applications of sequence clustering do not use a phylogenetic tree and instead operate on pairwise sequence distances. Due to advances in large-scale phylogenetic inference, we argue that tree-based clustering is under-utilized. We define a family of optimization problems that, given an arbitrary tree, return the minimum number of clusters such that all clusters adhere to constraints on their heterogeneity. We study three specific constraints, limiting (1) the diameter of each cluster, (2) the sum of its branch lengths, or (3) chains of pairwise distances. These three problems can be solved in time that increases linearly with the size of the tree, and for two of the three criteria, the algorithms have been known in the theoretical computer scientist literature. We implement these algorithms in a tool called TreeCluster, which we test on three applications: OTU clustering for microbiome data, HIV transmission clustering, and divide-and-conquer multiple sequence alignment. We show that, by using tree-based distances, TreeCluster generates more internally consistent clusters than alternatives and improves the effectiveness of downstream applications.

Metabolic analysis suggests that the ancestors to both lineages were non-photosynthetic, anaerobic, motile, and obligately fermentative. Cyanobacterial light sensing may have been facilitated by regulators present in the ancestor of these lineages. The subsurface organism has the capacity for nitrogen fixation using a nitrogenase distinct from that in Cyanobacteria, suggesting nitrogen fixation evolved separately in the two lineages. We hypothesize that Cyanobacteria split from Melainabacteria prior or due to the acquisition of oxygenic photosynthesis. Melainabacteria remained in anoxic zones and differentiated by niche adaptation, including for symbiosis in the mammalian gut.},

	abstract = {Hyperbolic spaces have recently gained momentum in the context of machine learning due to their high capacity and tree-likeliness properties. However, the representational power of hyperbolic geometry is not yet on par with Euclidean geometry, mostly because of the absence of corresponding hyperbolic neural network layers. This makes it hard to use hyperbolic embeddings in downstream tasks. Here, we bridge this gap in a principled manner by combining the formalism of Möbius gyrovector spaces with the Riemannian geometry of the Poincaré model of hyperbolic spaces. As a result, we derive hyperbolic versions of important deep learning tools: multinomial logistic regression, feed-forward and recurrent neural networks such as gated recurrent units. This allows to embed sequential data and perform classification in the hyperbolic space. Empirically, we show that, even if hyperbolic optimization tools are limited, hyperbolic sentence embeddings either outperform or are on par with their Euclidean variants on textual entailment and noisy-prefix recognition tasks.},

In order to compute a hyperbolic embedding from comparison or similarity information, one has to solve a hyperbolic distance geometry problem. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to compute hyperbolic embeddings from an arbitrary mix of noisy metric and non-metric data. Our algorithms are based on semidefinite programming and the notion of a hyperbolic distance matrix, in many ways parallel to its famous Euclidean counterpart. A central ingredient we put forward is a semidefinite characterization of the hyperbolic Gramian - -a matrix of Lorentzian inner products. This characterization allows us to formulate a semidefinite relaxation to efficiently compute hyperbolic embeddings in two stages: first, we complete and denoise the observed hyperbolic distance matrix; second, we propose a spectral factorization method to estimate the embedded points from the hyperbolic distance matrix. We show through numerical experiments how the flexibility to mix metric and non-metric constraints allows us to efficiently compute embeddings from arbitrary data.},

	abstract = {Background: Travelers' diarrhea (TD) is often caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, other bacterial pathogens, Norovirus, and occasionally parasites. Nevertheless, standard diagnostic methods fail to identify pathogens in more than 40\% of TD patients. It is predicted that new pathogens may be causative agents of the disease. Results: We performed a comprehensive amplicon and whole genome shotgun (WGS) metagenomic study of the fecal microbiomes from 23 TD patients and seven healthy travelers, all of which were negative for the known etiologic agents of TD based on standard microbiological and immunological assays. Abnormal and diverse taxonomic profiles in TD samples were revealed. WGS reads were assembled and the resulting contigs were visualized using multiple query types. A semi-manual workflow was applied to isolate independent genomes from metagenomic pools. A total of 565 genome bins were extracted, 320 of which were complete enough to be characterized as cellular genomes; 160 were viral genomes. We made predictions of the etiology of disease for many of the individual subjects based on the properties and features of the recovered genomes. Multiple patients with low-diversity metagenomes were predominated by one to several E. coli strains. Functional annotation allowed prediction of pathogenic type in many cases. Five patients were co-infected with E. coli and other members of Enterobacteriaceae, including Enterobacter, Klebsiella, and Citrobacter; these may represent blooms of organisms that appear following secretory diarrhea. New "dark matter" microbes were observed in multiple samples. In one, we identified a novel TM7 genome that phylogenetically clustered with a sludge isolate; it carries genes encoding potential virulence factors. In multiple samples, we observed high proportions of putative novel viral genomes, some of which form clusters with the ubiquitous gut virus, crAssphage. The total relative abundance of viruses was significantly higher in healthy travelers versus TD patients. Conclusion: Our study highlights the strength of assembly-based metagenomics, especially the manually curated, visualization-assisted binning of contigs, in resolving unusual and under-characterized pathogenic profiles of human-associated microbiomes. Results show that TD may be polymicrobial, with multiple novel cellular and viral strains as potential players in the diarrheal disease.},

	abstract = {Species tree inference is fundamental to our understanding of the evolution of life on earth. However, species tree inference from molecular sequence data is complicated by gene duplication events that limit the availably of suitable data for phylogenetic reconstruction. Here we propose a novel method for species tree inference called STAG that is specifically designed to leverage data from multi-copy gene families. By application to 12 real species datasets sampled from across the eukaryotic domain we demonstrate that species trees inferred from multi-copy gene families are comparable in accuracy to species trees inferred from single-copy orthologues. We further show that the ability to utilise data from multi-copy gene families increases the amount of data available for species tree inference by an average of 8 fold. We reveal that on real species datasets STAG has higher accuracy than other leading methods for species tree inference; including concatenated alignments of protein sequences, ASTRAL \&amp;amp; NJst. Finally we show that STAG is fast, memory efficient and scalable and thus suitable for analysis of large multispecies datasets.},

	abstract = {Horseshoe crabs (Xiphosura) are traditionally regarded as sister group to the clade of terrestrial chelicerates (Arachnida). This hypothesis has been challenged by recent phylogenomic analyses, but the non-monophyly of Arachnida has consistently been disregarded as artifactual. We re-evaluated the placement of Xiphosura among chelicerates using the most complete phylogenetic data set to date, expanding outgroup sampling, and including data from whole genome sequencing projects. In spite of uncertainty in the placement of some arachnid clades, all analyses show Xiphosura consistently nested within Arachnida as the sister group to Ricinulei (hooded tick spiders). It is apparent that the radiation of arachnids is an old one and occurred over a brief period of time, resulting in several consecutive short internodes, and thus is a potential case for the confounding effects of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). We simulated coalescent gene trees to explore the effects of increasing levels of ILS on the placement of horseshoe crabs. In addition, common sources of systematic error were evaluated, as well as the effects of fast-evolving partitions and the dynamics of problematic long branch orders. Our results indicated that the placement of horseshoe crabs cannot be explained by missing data, compositional biases, saturation, or ILS. Interrogation of the phylogenetic signal showed that the majority of loci favor the derived placement of Xiphosura over a monophyletic Arachnida. Our analyses support the inference that horseshoe crabs represent a group of aquatic arachnids, comparable to aquatic mites, breaking a long-standing paradigm in chelicerate evolution and altering previous interpretations of the ancestral transition to the terrestrial habitat. Future studies testing chelicerate relationships should approach the task with a sampling strategy where the monophyly of Arachnida is not held as the premise.},

SimPhy implements a hierarchical phylogenetic model in which the evolution of species, locus, and gene trees is governed by global and local parameters (e.g., genome-wide, species-specific, locus-specific), that can be fixed or be sampled from a priori statistical distributions. SimPhy also incorporates comprehensive models of substitution rate variation among lineages (uncorrelated relaxed clocks) and the capability of simulating partitioned nucleotide, codon, and protein multilocus sequence alignments under a plethora of substitution models using the program INDELible. We validate SimPhy's output using theoretical expectations and other programs, and show that it scales extremely well with complex models and/or large trees, being an order of magnitude faster than the most similar program (DLCoal-Sim). In addition, we demonstrate how SimPhy can be useful to understand interactions among different evolutionary processes, conducting a simulation study to characterize the systematic overestimation of the duplication time when using standard reconciliation methods.

Large genomic tracts are homozygous in three diploid species, possibly resulting from recent recombination events.

These include major differences at the mating-type loci (MTL); Lodderomyces elongisporus lacks MTL, and components of the a1/α2 cell identity determinant were lost in other species, raising questions about how mating and cell types are controlled.

Comparative and experimental analysis of a reference genome assembly for a double haploid YY male garden asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L.) individual implicates separate but linked genes as responsible for sex determination. Dioecy has evolved recently within Asparagus and sex chromosomes are cytogenetically identical with the Y, harboring a megabase segment that is missing from the X. We show that deletion of this entire region results in a male-to-female conversion, whereas loss of a single suppressor of female development drives male-to-hermaphrodite conversion.

Despite its relative efficiency, the current single-threaded implementation of ASTRAL is falling behind the data growth trends is not able to analyze the largest available datasets in a reasonable time. Results: ASTRAL uses dynamic programing and is not trivially parallel.

The currently preferred molecular technique, barcoding, has been very successful, but is based on short organelle markers. Recently, an alternative genome-skimming approach has been proposed: low-pass sequencing (100Mb - several Gb per sample) is applied to voucher and/or query samples, and marker genes and/or organelle genomes are recovered computationally. The current practice of genome-skimming discards the vast majority of the data because the low coverage of genome-skims prevents assembling the nuclear genomes. In contrast, we suggest using all unassembled reads directly, but existing methods poorly support this goal. We introduce a new alignment-free tool, Skmer, to estimate genomic distances between the query and each reference genome-skim using the kmer decomposition of reads. We test Skmer on a large set of insect and bird genomes, sub-sampled to create genome-skims. Skmer shows great accuracy in estimating genomic distances, identifying the closest match in a reference dataset, and inferring the phylogeny.},

The accuracy of the algorithm is evaluated on several real-world data sets and compared to placement by pair-wise sequence comparison, using edit distances and BLAST. We test two versions of the placement algorithm, one slow and more accurate where branch length optimization is conducted for each short read insertion and a faster version where the branch lengths are approximated at the insertion position. For the slow version, additional heuristic techniques are explored that almost yield the same run time as the fast version, with only a small loss of accuracy. When those additional heuristics are employed the run time of the more accurate algorithm is comparable to that of a simple BLAST search for data sets with a high number of short query sequences. Moreover, the accuracy of the Evolutionary Placement Algorithm is significantly higher, in particular when the taxon sampling of the reference topology is sparse or inadequate. Our algorithm, which has been integrated into RAxML, therefore provides an equally fast but more accurate alternative to BLAST for phylogeny-aware analysis of short-read sequence data.},

	abstract = {Understanding the patterns and processes underlying the uneven distribution of biodiversity across space constitutes a major scientific challenge in systematic biology and biogeography, which largely relies on effectively mapping and making sense of rapidly increasing species occurrence data. There is thus an urgent need for making the process of coding species into spatial units faster, automated, transparent, and reproducible. Here we present SpeciesGeoCoder, an open-source software package written in Python and R, that allows for easy coding of species into user-defined operational units. These units may be of any size and be purely spatial (i.e., polygons) such as countries and states, conservation areas, biomes, islands, biodiversity hotspots, and areas of endemism, but may also include elevation ranges. This flexibility allows scoring species into complex categories, such as those encountered in topographically and ecologically heterogeneous landscapes. In addition, SpeciesGeoCoder can be used to facilitate sorting and cleaning of occurrence data obtained from online databases, and for testing the impact of incorrect identification of specimens on the spatial coding of species. The various outputs of SpeciesGeoCoder include quantitative biodiversity statistics, global and local distribution maps, and files that can be used directly in many phylogeny-based applications for ancestral range reconstruction, investigations of biome evolution, and other comparative methods. Our simulations indicate that even datasets containing hundreds of millions of records can be analyzed in relatively short time using a standard computer. We exemplify the use of SpeciesGeoCoder by inferring the historical dispersal of birds across the Isthmus of Panama, showing that lowland species crossed the Isthmus about twice as frequently as montane species with a marked increase in the number of dispersals during the last 10 million years.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Consider a simple computational problem. The inputs are (i) the set of mixed reads generated from a sample that combines two organisms and (ii) separate sets of reads for several reference genomes of known origins. The goal is to find the two organisms that constitute the mixed sample. When constituents are absent from the reference set, we seek to phylogenetically position them with respect to the underlying tree of the reference species. This simple yet fundamental problem (which we call phylogenetic double-placement) has enjoyed surprisingly little attention in the literature. As genome skimming (low-pass sequencing of genomes at low coverage, precluding assembly) becomes more prevalent, this problem finds wide-ranging applications in areas as varied as biodiversity research, food production and provenance, and evolutionary reconstruction. RESULTS: We introduce a model that relates distances between a mixed sample and reference species to the distances between constituents and reference species. Our model is based on Jaccard indices computed between each sample represented as k-mer sets. The model, built on several assumptions and approximations, allows us to formalize the phylogenetic double-placement problem as a non-convex optimization problem that decomposes mixture distances and performs phylogenetic placement simultaneously. Using a variety of techniques, we are able to solve this optimization problem numerically. We test the resulting method, called MIxed Sample Analysis tool (MISA), on a varied set of simulated and biological datasets. Despite all the assumptions used, the method performs remarkably well in practice.

The currently preferred molecular technique, barcoding, has been very successful, but is based on short organelle markers. Recently, an alternative genome-skimming approach has been proposed: low-pass sequencing (100Mb - several Gb per sample) is applied to voucher and/or query samples, and marker genes and/or organelle genomes are recovered computationally. The current practice of genome-skimming discards the vast majority of the data because the low coverage of genome-skims prevents assembling the nuclear genomes. In contrast, we suggest using all unassembled reads directly, but existing methods poorly support this goal. We introduce a new alignment-free tool, Skmer, to estimate genomic distances between the query and each reference genome-skim using the kmer decomposition of reads. We test Skmer on a large set of insect and bird genomes, sub-sampled to create genome-skims. Skmer shows great accuracy in estimating genomic distances, identifying the closest match in a reference dataset, and inferring the phylogeny.},

However, this incongruence has not yet been demonstrated in empirical studies. Several key relationships among eutherian mammals remain controversial and conflicting among previous studies, including the root of eutherian tree and the relationships within Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria. Both Bayesian and maximum-likelihood analysis of genome-wide data of 447 nuclear genes from 37 species show that concatenation methods indeed yield strong incongruence in the phylogeny of eutherian mammals, as revealed by subsampling analyses of loci and taxa, which produced strongly conflicting topologies. In contrast, the coalescent methods, which accommodate gene tree heterogeneity, yield a phylogeny that is robust to variable gene and taxon sampling and is congruentwith geographic data. The data also demonstrate that incomplete lineage sorting, a major source of gene tree heterogeneity, is relevant to deep-level phylogenies, such as those among eutherian mammals. Our results firmly place the eutherian root between Atlantogenata and Boreoeutheria and support ungulate polyphyly and a sister-group relationship between Scandentia and Primates. This study demonstrates that the incongruence introduced by concatenation methods is a major cause of long-standing uncertainty in the phylogeny of eutherian mammals, and the same may apply to other clades. Our analyses suggest that such incongruence can be resolved using phylogenomic data and coalescent methods that deal explicitly with gene tree heterogeneity.},

Conceptually situated between supervised and unsupervised learning, it permits harnessing the large amounts of unlabelled data available in many use cases in combination with typically smaller sets of labelled data. In recent years, research in this area has followed the general trends observed in machine learning, with much attention directed at neural network-based models and generative learning. The literature on the topic has also expanded in volume and scope, now encompassing a broad spectrum of theory, algorithms and applications. However, no recent surveys exist to collect and organize this knowledge, impeding the ability of researchers and engineers alike to utilize it. Filling this void, we present an up-to-date overview of semi-supervised learning methods, covering earlier work as well as more recent advances. We focus primarily on semi-supervised classification, where the large majority of semi-supervised learning research takes place. Our survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners new to the field as well as more advanced readers with a solid understanding of the main approaches and algorithms developed over the past two decades, with an emphasis on the most prominent and currently relevant work. Furthermore, we propose a new taxonomy of semi-supervised classification algorithms, which sheds light on the different conceptual and methodological approaches for incorporating unlabelled data into the training process. Lastly, we show how the fundamental assumptions underlying most semi-supervised learning algorithms are closely connected to each other, and how they relate to the well-known semi-supervised clustering assumption.},

Further, some methods can have undesirable statistical properties such as statistical inconsistency and/or the tendency to be positively misleading (i.e. assert strong support for the incorrect tree topology). Recently, deep learning techniques have made inroads on a number of both new and longstanding problems in biological research. In this study, we designed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to infer quartet topologies from multiple sequence alignments. This CNN can readily be trained to make inferences using both gapped and ungapped data. We show that our approach is highly accurate on simulated data, often outperforming traditional methods, and is remarkably robust to bias-inducing regions of parameter space such as the Felsenstein zone and the Farris zone. We also demonstrate that the confidence scores produced by our CNN can more accurately assess support for the chosen topology than bootstrap and posterior probability scores from traditional methods. Although numerous practical challenges remain, these findings suggest that the deep learning approaches such as ours have the potential to produce more accurate phylogenetic inferences.},

Because PacBio data has higher sequencing error rate and lower coverage than popular short read sequencing technologies (such as Illumina), efficient detection of true overlaps requires specially designed algorithms.

The potential for discordance between the gene trees has motivated the development of summary methods that reconstruct a species tree from an input collection of gene trees. ASTRAL is a widely used summary method and has been able to scale to relatively large datasets. However, the size of genomic datasets is quickly growing. Despite its relative efficiency, the current single-threaded implementation of ASTRAL is falling behind the data growth trends is not able to analyze the largest available datasets in a reasonable time. Results: ASTRAL uses dynamic programing and is not trivially parallel. In this paper, we introduce ASTRAL-MP, the first version of ASTRAL that can exploit parallelism and also uses randomization techniques to speed up some of its steps. Importantly, ASTRAL-MP can take advantage of not just multiple CPU cores but also one or several graphics processing units (GPUs). The ASTRAL-MP code scales very well with increasing CPU cores, and its GPU version, implemented in OpenCL, can have up to 158× speedups compared to ASTRAL-III.

To broadly sample bumblebee genomic and phenotypic diversity, we de novo sequenced and assembled the genomes of 17 species, representing all 15 subgenera, producing the first genus-wide quantification of genetic and genomic variation potentially underlying key ecological and behavioral traits. The species phylogeny resolves subgenera relationships while incomplete lineage sorting likely drives high levels of gene tree discordance. Five chromosome-level assemblies show a stable 18-chromosome karyotype, with major rearrangements creating 25 chromosomes in social parasites. Differential transposable element activity drives changes in genome sizes, with putative domestications of repetitive sequences influencing gene coding and regulatory potential. Dynamically evolving gene families and signatures of positive selection point to genus-wide variation in processes linked to foraging, diet and metabolism, immunity and detoxification, as well as adaptations for life at high altitudes. Our study reveals how bumblebee genes and genomes have evolved across the Bombus phylogeny and identifies variations potentially linked to key ecological and behavioral traits of these important pollinators.},

	abstract = {Bacteria can exchange genetic material, or acquire genes found in the environment. This process, generally known as bacterial recombination, can have a strong impact on the evolution and phenotype of bacteria, for example causing the spread of antibiotic resistance across clades and species, but can also disrupt phylogenetic and transmission inferences. With the increasing affordability of whole genome sequencing, the need has emerged for an efficient simulator of bacterial evolution to test and compare methods for phylogenetic and population genetic inference, and for simulation-based estimation. We present SimBac, a whole-genome bacterial evolution simulator that is roughly two orders of magnitude faster than previous software and includes a more general model of bacterial evolution, allowing both within- and between-species homologous recombination. Since methods modelling bacterial recombination generally focus on only one of these two modes of recombination, the possibility to simulate both allows for a general and fair benchmarking.

The distances are defined by enumerating all subsets of three labels (triplets) and four labels (quartets), respectively, and counting how often the induced topologies in the two input trees are different. In this paper we present efficient algorithms for computing these distances. We show how to compute the triplet distance in time O(n log n) and the quartet distance in time O(dn log n), where d is the maximal degree of any node in the two trees. Within the same time bounds, our framework also allows us to compute the parameterized triplet and quartet distances, where a parameter is introduced to weight resolved (binary) topologies against unresolved (non-binary) topologies. The previous best algorithm for computing the triplet and parameterized triplet distances have O(n2) running time, while the previous best algorithms for computing the quartet distance include an O(d 9n log n) time algorithm and an O(n2.688) time algorithm, where the latter can also compute the parameterized quartet distance. Since d ≤ n, our algorithms improve on all these algorithms. Copyright © SIAM.},

The triplet and quartet distances, for rooted and unrooted trees, respectively, are defined as the number of subsets of three or four leaves, respectively, where the topologies of the induced subtrees differ. These distances can trivially be computed by explicitly enumerating all sets of three or four leaves and testing if the topologies are different, but this leads to time complexities at least of the order n3 or n4 just for enumerating the sets.

	abstract = {Background: At the individual level, higher HIV viral load predicts sexual transmission risk. We evaluated San Francisco's community viral load (CVL) as a population level marker of HIV transmission risk. We hypothesized that the decrease in CVL in San Francisco from 2004-2008, corresponding with increased rates of HIV testing, antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage and effectiveness, and population-level virologic suppression, would be associated with a reduction in new HIV infections. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used San Francisco's HIV/AIDS surveillance system to examine the trends in CVL. Mean CVL was calculated as the mean of the most recent viral load of all reported HIV-positive individuals in a particular community. Total CVL was defined as the sum of the most recent viral loads of all HIV-positive individuals in a particular community. We used Poisson models with robust standard errors to assess the relationships between the mean and total CVL and the primary outcome: annual numbers of newly diagnosed HIV cases. Both mean and total CVL decreased from 2004-2008 and were accompanied by decreases in new HIV diagnoses from 798 (2004) to 434 (2008). The mean (p = 0.003) and total CVL (p = 0.002) were significantly associated with new HIV cases from 2004-2008. Conclusions/Significance: Reductions in CVL are associated with decreased HIV infections. Results suggest that wide-scale ART could reduce HIV transmission at the population level. Because CVL is temporally upstream of new HIV infections, jurisdictions should consider adding CVL to routine HIV surveillance to track the epidemic, allocate resources, and to evaluate the effectiveness of HIV prevention and treatment efforts. © 2010 Das et al.},

	abstract = {Partner counseling and referral services (PCRS) are part of the spectrum of care for HIV-positive people and their sexual or needle-sharing partners. Referral includes notifying partners of exposure, after which they are (ideally) tested and receive prevention or risk reduction counseling or enter into care (if they test positive). Using The Guide to Community Preventive Services's methods for systematic reviews, the effectiveness of PCRS was evaluated, including partner notification, in identifying a population at high risk of HIV infection and in increasing testing in those populations. In this review, PCRS efforts using provider referral were found to be effective in reaching a population with a high prevalence of HIV. Nine studies qualified for the review. In these studies, a range of one to eight partners was identified per index case (a person newly diagnosed with HIV who has partners who should be notified); a mean of 67\% of identified partners were found and notified of their potential exposure to HIV, and a mean of 63\% of those notified were tested (previously known "positives" were not tested). Of those tested, a mean of 20\% were HIV positive. Therefore, even given that not all partners could be found and notified and that some who could be found did not accept testing, 1\% to 8\% of people named as potentially exposed and not previously known to be HIV positive were identified as HIV positive through partner notification (although these people were not necessarily infected by the index case). Evidence was insufficient to determine whether PCRS, including partner notification, was also effective in changing behavior or reducing transmission because available studies did not generally report on these outcomes. Little empirical evidence was available to assess potential harm of the interventions, but current studies have not shown substantial harms. Based on Community Guide rules of evidence, sufficient evidence shows that PCRS with partner notification by a public health professional ("provider referral") effectively increases identification of a high-prevalence target population for HIV testing. © 2007 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

	abstract = {The root of the angiosperm tree has not yet been established. Major morphological and molecular differences between angiosperms and other seed plants have introduced ambiguities and possibly spurious results. Because it is unlikely that extant species more closely related to angiosperms will be discovered, and because relevant fossils will almost certainly not yield molecular data, the use of duplicate genes for rooting purposes may provide the best hope of a solution. Simultaneous analysis of the genes resulting from a gene duplication event along the branch subtending angiosperms would yield an unrooted network, wherein two congruent gene trees should be connected by a single branch. In these circumstances the best rooted species tree is the one that corresponds to the two gene trees when the network is rooted along the connecting branch. In general, this approach can be viewed as choosing among rooted species trees by minimizing hypothesized events such as gene duplication, gene loss, lineage sorting, and lateral transfer. Of those gene families that are potentially relevant to the angiosperm problem, phytochrome genes warrant special attention. Phylogenetic analysis of a sample of complete phytochrome (PHY) sequences implies that an initial duplication event preceded (or occurred early within) the radiation of seed plants and that each of the two resulting copies duplicated again. In one of these cases, leading to thePHYAandPHYClineages, duplication appears to have occurred before the diversification of angiosperms. Duplicate gene trees are congruent in these broad analyses, but the sample of sequences is too limited to provide much insight into the rooting question. Preliminary analyses of partialPHYAandPHYCsequences from several presumably basal angiosperm lineages are promising, but more data are needed to critically evaluate the power of these genes to resolve the angiosperm radiation. © 1998 Academic Press.},

Methods: We collected data on HIV PS procedures and outcomes in 2006 from health departments in US metropolitan areas with the highest number of cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, and primary and secondary syphilis, and compared our results with the data collected through a similar study carried out in 2001. RESULTS: Of the 71 eligible jurisdictions, 51 (72\%) participated in this study. In 2006, health departments interviewed 11,270 (43\%) of the 26,185 persons with newly reported HIV, which was an increase from the 32\% reported in 2001 (P {\textless} 0.01). Among 10,498 potentially exposed partners, 2228 (21\%) had been previously diagnosed with HIV, 803 (8\%) were newly HIV-diagnosed, 3337 (32\%) tested HIV-negative, and 4130 (39\%) were not successfully notified, were notified but refused HIV testing and denied previous diagnosis, or did not have an outcome recorded. Combining data from all jurisdictions, public health staff needed to interview 13.6 persons with HIV to identify one new case of infection; this number was unchanged from 2001 (13.8; P = 0.75). Conclusion: In the United States, the proportion of persons diagnosed with HIV receiving PS has increased since 2001, whereas HIV case-finding yields have remained stable.

	abstract = {Reconstructing relationships among extant birds (Neornithes) has been one of the most difficult problems in phylogenetics, and, despite intensive effort, the avian tree of life remains (at least partially) unresolved. Thus far, the most difficult problem is the relationship among the orders of Neoaves, the major clade that includes the most (\{{\textbackslash}textasciitilde\}95\%) named bird species. This clade appears to have undergone a rapid radiation near the end Cretaceous mass extinction (the K-Pg boundary). On the other hand, if one embraces a ``glass half full'' view, the fact that most orders in Neoaves can be placed into seven clades, recently designated the ``magnificent seven,'' could be viewed as remarkable progress. We propose that the dawning era of whole-genome phylogenetics will only resolve the remaining relationships, if we improve data quality, exploit information from other sources (i.e., rare genomic changes), and learn more about the functional and evolutionary landscape of avian genomes. Of course, it is possible that the remaining unresolved relationships are unresolvable regardless of the data available, but we suggest that the community should avoid this conclusion until more data collection has been completed and improved analyses have been conducted. We say this because there is ample evidence that estimates of avian phylogeny based on large-scale datasets may be affected by well-characterized artifacts (e.g., long-branch attraction, heterotachy, and discordance among gene trees) and by subtle ``data-type effects'' that reflect poor fit to empirical data for available models of sequence evolution. Even if these analytical challenges can be addressed, we need to integrate phylogenomic and fossil data. Finally, we also emphasize that, regardless of the resolution (or lack thereof) for relationships among major avian clades, we are only at the dawn of the phylogenomics of birds. Large-scale molecular data remain unavailable for the vast majority of the \{{\textbackslash}textasciitilde\}10,000 named bird species, and those named bird species probably represent an underestimate of the true number of distinct evolutionary lineages of birds (whether or not those lineages are assigned the rank of species) by as much as threefold. A true biodiversity genomics effort in birds is likely to reveal many additional examples of cases where it is very difficult to resolve relationships; the effort to resolve as many of those relationships as possible will represent a major scientific achievement and provide lessons for phylogenomic studies in other parts of the tree of life.},

	abstract = {Whole-genome sequencing projects are increasingly populating the tree of life and characterizing biodiversity 1–4 . Sparse taxon sampling has previously been proposed to confound phylogenetic inference 5 , and captures only a fraction of the genomic diversity. Here we report a substantial step towards the dense representation of avian phylogenetic and molecular diversity, by analysing 363 genomes from 92.4\% of bird families—including 267 newly sequenced genomes produced for phase II of the Bird 10,000 Genomes (B10K) Project. We use this comparative genome dataset in combination with a pipeline that leverages a reference-free whole-genome alignment to identify orthologous regions in greater numbers than has previously been possible and to recognize genomic novelties in particular bird lineages. The densely sampled alignment provides a single-base-pair map of selection, has more than doubled the fraction of bases that are confidently predicted to be under conservation and reveals extensive patterns of weak selection in predominantly non-coding DNA. Our results demonstrate that increasing the diversity of genomes used in comparative studies can reveal more shared and lineage-specific variation, and improve the investigation of genomic characteristics. We anticipate that this genomic resource will offer new perspectives on evolutionary processes in cross-species comparative analyses and assist in efforts to conserve species.},

	abstract = {Multiple sequence alignment is one of the cornerstones of modern molecular biology. It is used to identify conserved motifs, to determine protein domains, in 2D/3D structure prediction by homology and in evolutionary studies. Recently, high-throughput technologies such as genome sequencing and structural proteomics have lead to an explosion in the amount of sequence and structure information available. In response, several new multiple alignment methods have been developed that improve both the efficiency and the quality of protein alignments. Consequently, the benchmarks used to evaluate and compare these methods must also evolve. We present here the latest release of the most widely used multiple alignment benchmark, BAliBASE, which provides high quality, manually refined, reference alignments based on 3D structural superpositions. Version 3.0 of BAliBASE includes new, more challenging test cases, representing the real problems encountered when aligning large sets of complex sequences. Using a novel, semiautomatic update protocol, the number of protein families in the benchmark has been increased and representative test cases are now available that cover most of the protein fold space. The total number of proteins in BAliBASE has also been significantly increased from 1444 to 6255 sequences. In addition, full-length sequences are now provided for all test cases, which represent difficult cases for both global and local alignment programs. Finally, the BAliBASE Web site (http://www-bio3d-igbomc.u-strasbg.fr/balibase) has been completely redesigned to provide a more user-friendly, interactive interface for the visualization of the BAliBASE reference alignments and the associated annotations. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Analyses often reveal abundant discordances among phylogenies of different parts of genomes, as well as incongruences between species trees obtained using different methods or data partitions. Researchers are often left trying to make sense of such incongruences. Interpretive ways of measuring and visualizing discordance are needed, both among alternative species trees and gene trees, especially for specific focal branches of a tree. Here, we introduce DiscoVista, a publicly available tool that creates a suite of simple but interpretable visualizations.

The quality of such public resources are therefore of critical importance. Errors due to contamination are particularly worrying; they are widespread, propagate across databases, and can compromise downstream analyses, especially the detection of horizontally-transferred sequences. However we still lack consistent and comprehensive assessments of contamination prevalence in public genomic data. Here we applied a standardized procedure for foreign sequence annotation to 43 published arthropod genomes from the widely used Ensembl Metazoa database. This method combines information on sequence similarity and synteny to identify contaminant and putative horizontally-transferred sequences in any genome assembly, provided that an adequate reference database is available. We uncovered considerable heterogeneity in quality among arthropod assemblies, some being devoid of contaminant sequences, whereas others included hundreds of contaminant genes. Contaminants far outnumbered horizontally-transferred genes and were a major confounder of their detection, quantification and analysis. We strongly recommend that automated standardized decontamination procedures be systematically embedded into the submission process to genomic databases.},

Methods to identify signatures of selective sweeps in population genomics data have been actively developed, but mostly do not identify the specific mutation favored by the selective sweep. We present a method, iSAFE, that uses a statistic derived solely from population genetics signals to pinpoint the favored mutation even when the signature of selection extends to 5Mbp. iSAFE was tested extensively on simulated data and in human populations from the 1000 Genomes Project, at 22 loci with previously characterized selective sweeps. For 14 of the 22 loci, iSAFE ranked the previously characterized candidate mutation among the 13 highest scoring (out of ∼ 21, 000 variants). Three loci did not show a strong signal. For the remaining loci, iSAFE identified previously unreported mutations as being favored. In these regions, all of which involve pigmentation related genes, iSAFE identified identical selected mutations in multiple non-African populations suggesting an out-of-Africa onset of selection.

Phylogenetic trees inferred from sequence data often have branch lengths measured in the expected number of substitutions and therefore, do not have divergence times estimated. These trees give an incomplete view of evolutionary histories since many applications of phylogenies require time trees. Many methods have been developed to convert the inferred branch lengths from substitution unit to time unit using calibration points, but none is universally accepted as they are challenged in both scalability and accuracy under complex models. Here, we introduce a new method that formulates dating as a non-convex optimization problem where the variance of log-transformed rate multipliers are minimized across the tree. On simulated and real data, we show that our method, wLogDate, is often more accurate than alternatives and is more robust to various model assumptions.},

Computational approaches analyze the large volumes of sequence data obtained from these ecological samples, to provide an understanding of the species diversity, content and abundance. In this work we present a scalable, species diversity estimation algorithm that achieves computational efficiency by use of a locality sensitive hashing algorithm (LSH). Using fixed-length, gapless subsequences, we improve the sensitivity of pairwise sequence comparisons. Using the LSH-based function, we first group similar sequences into bins commonly referred to as operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and then compute several species diversity/richness metrics. The performance of our algorithm is evaluated on synthetic data and eight targeted metagenome samples obtained from the seawater. We compare our results to three state-of-the-art diversity estimation algorithms. We demonstrate the strength of our approach in terms of computational runtime and effective OTU assignments.

	abstract = {Motivation: Comparison of multimegabase genomic DNA sequences is a popular technique for finding and annotating conserved genome features. Performing such comparisons entails finding many short local alignments between sequences up to tens of megabases in length. To process such long sequences efficiently, existing algorithms find alignments by expanding around short runs of matching bases with no substitutions or other differences. Unfortunately, exact matches that are short enough to occur often in significant alignments also occur frequently by chance in the background sequence. Thus, these algorithms must trade off between efficiency and sensitivity to features without long exact matches. Results: We introduce a new algorithm, LSH-ALL-PAIRS, to find ungapped local alignments in genomic sequence with up to a specified fraction of substitutions. The length and substitution rate of these alignments can be chosen so that they appear frequently in significant similarities yet still remain rare in the background sequence. The algorithm finds ungapped alignments efficiently using a randomized search technique, locality-sensitive hashing. We have found LSH-ALL-PAIRS to be both efficient and sensitive for finding local similarities with as little as 63\% identity in mammalian genomic sequences up to tens of megabases in length.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Sequence alignment is a central operation in bioinformatics pipeline and, despite many improvements, remains a computationally challenging problem. Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is one method used to estimate the likelihood of two sequences to have a proper alignment. Using an LSH, it is possible to separate, with high probability and relatively low computation, the pairs of sequences that do not have high-quality alignment from those that may. Therefore, an LSH reduces the overall computational requirement while not introducing many false negatives (i.e. omitting to report a valid alignment). However, current LSH methods treat sequences as a bag of k-mers and do not take into account the relative ordering of k-mers in sequences. In addition, due to the lack of a practical LSH method for edit distance, in practice, LSH methods for Jaccard similarity or Hamming similarity are used as a proxy. Results: We present an LSH method, called Order Min Hash (OMH), for the edit distance. This method is a refinement of the minHash LSH used to approximate the Jaccard similarity, in that OMH is sensitive not only to the k-mer contents of the sequences but also to the relative order of the k-mers in the sequences. We present theoretical guarantees of the OMH as a gapped LSH.},

Several researchers are interested in metagenomics because it provides an insight into the complex biodiversity across several environments. Clinicians are using metagenomics to determine the role played by collection of microbial organisms within human body with respect to human health wellness and disease. Results: We have developed an efficient and scalable, species richness estimation algorithm that uses locality sensitive hashing (LSH). Our algorithm achieves efficiency by approximating the pairwise sequence comparison operations using hashing and also incorporates matching of fixed-length, gapless subsequences criterion to improve the quality of sequence comparisons. We use LSH-based similarity function to cluster similar sequences and make individual groups, called operational taxonomic units (OTUs). We also compute different species diversity/richness metrics by utilizing OTU assignment results to further extend our analysis.

	abstract = {Although horizontal gene transfer is recognized as a major evolutionary process in Bacteria and Archaea, its general patterns remain elusive, due to difficulties tracking genes at relevant resolution and scale within complex microbiomes. To circumvent these challenges, we analyzed a randomized sample of \&amp;gt;12,000 genomes of individual cells of Bacteria and Archaea in the tropical and subtropical ocean - a well-mixed, global environment. We found that marine microorganisms form gene exchange networks (GENs) within which transfers of both flexible and core genes are frequent, including the rRNA operon that is commonly used as a conservative taxonomic marker. The data revealed efficient gene exchange among genomes with \&amp;lt;28\% nucleotide difference, indicating that GENs are much broader lineages than the nominal microbial species, which are currently delineated at 4-6\% nucleotide difference. The 42 largest GENs accounted for 90\% of cells in the tropical ocean microbiome. Frequent gene exchange within GENs helps explain how marine microorganisms maintain millions of rare genes and adapt to a dynamic environment despite extreme genome streamlining of their individual cells. Our study suggests that sharing of pangenomes through horizontal gene transfer is a defining feature of fundamental evolutionary units in marine planktonic microorganisms and, potentially, other microbiomes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Phylogenies provide a useful way to understand the evolutionary history of genetic samples, and data sets with more than a thousand taxa are becoming increasingly common, notably with viruses (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)). Dating ancestral events is one of the first, essential goals with such data. However, current sophisticated probabilistic approaches struggle to handle data sets of this size. Here, we present very fast dating algorithms, based on a Gaussian model closely related to the Langley-Fitch molecular-clock model. We show that this model is robust to uncorrelated violations of the molecular clock. Our algorithms apply to serial data, where the tips of the tree have been sampled through times. They estimate the substitution rate and the dates of all ancestral nodes. When the input tree is unrooted, they can provide an estimate for the root position, thus representing a new, practical alternative to the standard rooting methods (e.g., midpoint). Our algorithms exploit the tree (recursive) structure of the problem at hand, and the close relationships between least-squares and linear algebra. We distinguish between an unconstrained setting and the case where the temporal precedence constraint (i.e., an ancestral node must be older that its daughter nodes) is accounted for. With rooted trees, the former is solved using linear algebra in linear computing time (i.e., proportional to the number of taxa), while the resolution of the latter, constrained setting, is based on an active-set method that runs in nearly linear time. With unrooted trees the computing time becomes (nearly) quadratic (i.e., proportional to the square of the number of taxa). In all cases, very large input trees ({\textgreater}10,000 taxa) can easily be processed and transformed into time-scaled trees. We compare these algorithms to standard methods (root-to-tip, r8s version of Langley-Fitch method, and BEAST). Using simulated data, we show that their estimation accuracy is similar to that of the most sophisticated methods, while their computing time is much faster. We apply these algorithms on a large data set comprising 1194 strains of Influenza virus from the pdm09 H1N1 Human pandemic. Again the results show that these algorithms provide a very fast alternative with results similar to those of other computer programs. These algorithms are implemented in the LSD software (least-squares dating), which can be downloaded from http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/LSD/, along with all our data sets and detailed results.

	abstract = {The mammalian gut is an attractive model for exploring the general question of how habitat impacts the evolution of gene content. Therefore, we have characterized the relationship between 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarity and overall levels of gene conservation in four groups of species: gut specialists and cosmopolitans, each of which can be divided into pathogens and non-pathogens. At short phylogenetic distances, specialist or cosmopolitan bacteria found in the gut share fewer genes than is typical for genomes that come from non-gut environments, but at longer phylogenetic distances gut bacteria are more similar to each other than are genomes at equivalent evolutionary distances from non-gut environments, suggesting a pattern of short-term specialization but long-term convergence. Moreover, this pattern is observed in both pathogens and non-pathogens, and can even be seen in the plasmids carried by gut bacteria. This observation is consistent with the finding that, despite considerable interpersonal variation in species content, there is surprising functional convergence in the microbiome of different humans. Finally, we observe that even within bacterial species or genera 16S rRNA divergence provides useful information about average conservation of gene content. The results described here should be useful for guiding strain selection to maximize novel gene discovery in large-scale genome sequencing projects, while the approach could be applied in studies seeking to understand the effects of habitat adaptation on genome evolution across other body habitats or environment types. © The Author(s) 2010.

We found the average nucleotide identity (ANI) of the shared genes between two strains to be a robust means to compare genetic relatedness among strains, and that ANI values of ≈94\% corresponded to the traditional 70\% DNA-DNA reassociation standard of the current species definition. At the 94\% ANI cutoff, current species includes only moderately homogeneous strains, e.g., most of the {\textgreater}4-Mb genomes share only 65-90\% of their genes, apparently as a result of the strains having evolved in different ecological settings. Furthermore, diagnostic genetic signatures (boundaries) are evident between groups of strains of the same species, and the intergroup genetic similarity can be as high as 98-99\% ANI, indicating that justifiable species might be found even among organisms that are nearly identical at the nucleotide level. Notably, a large fraction, e.g., up to 65\%, of the differences in gene content within species is associated with bacteriophage and transposase elements, revealing an important role of these elements during bacterial speciation. Our findings are consistent with a definition for species that would include a more homogeneous set of strains than provided by the current definition and one that considers the ecology of the strains in addition to their evolutionary distance.},

Although the use of such models is often criticized, the extent of SRH violations and their effects on phylogenetic inference of tree topologies and edge lengths are not well understood. Here, we introduce and apply the maximal matched-pairs tests of homogeneity to assess the scale and impact of SRH model violations on 3,572 partitions from 35 published phylogenetic data sets. We show that roughly one-quarter of all the partitions we analyzed (23.5\%) reject the SRH assumptions, and that for 25\% of data sets, tree topologies inferred from all partitions differ significantly from topologies inferred using the subset of partitions that do not reject the SRH assumptions. This proportion increases when comparing trees inferred using the subset of partitions that rejects the SRH assumptions, to those inferred from partitions that do not reject the SRH assumptions. These results suggest that the extent and effects of model violation in phylogenetics may be substantial. They highlight the importance of testing for model violations and possibly excluding partitions that violate models prior to tree reconstruction. Our results also suggest that further effort in developing models that do not require SRH assumptions could lead to large improvements in the accuracy of phylogenomic inference.

	abstract = {Phylogenetic inference is of fundamental importance to evolutionary as well as other fields of biology, and molecular sequences have emerged as the primary data for this task. Although many phylogenetic methods have been developed to explicitly take into account substitution models of sequence evolution, such methods could fail due to model misspecification or insufficiency, especially in the face of heterogeneities in substitution processes across sites and among lineages. In this study, we propose to infer topologies of four-taxon trees using deep residual neural networks, a machine learning approach needing no explicit modeling of the subject system and having a record of success in solving complex nonlinear inference problems. We train residual networks on simulated protein sequence data with extensive amino acid substitution heterogeneities. We show that the well-trained residual network predictors can outperform existing state-of-the-art inference methods such as the maximum likelihood method on diverse simulated test data, especially under extensive substitution heterogeneities. Reassuringly, residual network predictors generally agree with existing methods in the trees inferred from real phylogenetic data with known or widely believed topologies. Furthermore, when combined with the quartet puzzling algorithm, residual network predictors can be used to reconstruct trees with more than four taxa. We conclude that deep learning represents a powerful new approach to phylogenetic reconstruction, especially when sequences evolve via heterogeneous substitution processes.

	abstract = {Proteins have distinct structural and functional constraints at different sites that lead to site-specific preferences for particular amino acid residues as the sequences evolve. Heterogeneity in the amino acid substitution process between sites is not modeled by commonly used empirical amino acid exchange matrices. Such model misspecification can lead to artefacts in phylogenetic estimation such as long-branch attraction. Although sophisticated site-heterogeneous mixture models have been developed to address this problem in both Bayesian and maximum likelihood (ML) frameworks, their formidable computational time and memory usage severely limits their use in large phylogenomic analyses. Here we propose a posterior mean site frequency (PMSF) method as a rapid and efficient approximation to full empirical profile mixture models for ML analysis. The PMSF approach assigns a conditional mean amino acid frequency profile to each site calculated based on a mixture model fitted to the data using a preliminary guide tree. These PMSF profiles can then be used for in-depth tree-searching in place of the full mixture model. Compared to widely used empirical mixture models with k classes, our implementation of PMSF in IQ-TREE (http://www.iqtree.org) speeds up the computation by approximately k/1.5 fold and requires a small fraction of the RAM. Furthermore, this speedup allows, for the first time, full nonparametric bootstrap analyses to be conducted under complex site-heterogeneous models on large concatenated data matrices. Our simulations and empirical data analyses demonstrate that PMSF can effectively ameliorate long branch attraction artefacts. In some empirical and simulation settings PMSF provided more accurate estimates of phylogenies than the mixture models from which they derive.},

	abstract = {Background. Thanks to the large amount of signal contained in genome-wide sequence alignments, phylogenomic analyses are converging towards highly supported trees. However, high statistical support does not imply that the tree is accurate. Systematic errors, such as the Long Branch Attraction (LBA) artefact, can be misleading, in particular when the taxon sampling is poor, or the outgroup is distant. In an otherwise consistent probabilistic framework, systematic errors in genome-wide analyses can be traced back to model mis-specification problems, which suggests that better models of sequence evolution should be devised, that would be more robust to tree reconstruction artefacts, even under the most challenging conditions. Methods. We focus on a well characterized LBA artefact analyzed in a previous phylogenomic study of the metazoan tree, in which two fast-evolving animal phyla, nematodes and platyhelminths, emerge either at the base of all other Bilateria, or within protostomes, depending on the outgroup. We use this artefactual result as a case study for comparing the robustness of two alternative models: a standard, site-homogeneous model, based on an empirical matrix of amino-acid replacement (WAG), and a site-heterogeneous mixture model (CAT). In parallel, we propose a posterior predictive test, allowing one to measure how well a model acknowledges sequence saturation. Results. Adopting a Bayesian framework, we show that the LBA artefact observed under WAG disappears when the site-heterogeneous model CAT is used. Using cross-validation, we further demonstrate that CAT has a better statistical fit than WAG on this data set. Finally, using our statistical goodness-of-fit test, we show that CAT, but not WAG, correctly accounts for the overall level of saturation, and that this is due to a better estimation of site-specific amino-acid preferences. Conclusion. The CAT model appears to be more robust than WAG against LBA artefacts, essentially because it correctly anticipates the high probability of convergences and reversions implied by the small effective size of the amino-acid alphabet at each site of the alignment. More generally, our results provide strong evidence that site-specificities in the substitution process need be accounted for in order to obtain more reliable phylogenetic trees. © 2007 Lartillot et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Current modeling of selection via site-to- site rate heterogeneity generally neglects another aspect of selection, namely position-specific amino acid frequencies. These frequencies determine the maximum dissimilarity expected for highly diverged but functionally and structurally conserved sequences, and hence are crucial for estimating long distances. We introduce a codon-level model of coding sequence evolution in which position-specific amino acid frequencies are free parameters. In our implementation, these are estimated from an alignment using methods described previously. We use simulations to demonstrate the importance and feasibility of modeling such behavior; our model produces linear distance estimates over a wide range of distances, while several alternative models underestimate long distances relative to short distances. Site-to-site differences in rates, as well as synonymous/nonsynonymous and first/second/third-codon- position differences, arise as a natural consequence of the site-to-site differences in amino acid frequencies.},

In addition, well-resolved molecular phylogenies derived from these DNA barcode sequences have the potential to improve investigations of the mechanisms underlying community assembly and functional trait evolution. To date, no studies have effectively applied DNA barcodes sensu strictu in this manner. In this report, we demonstrate that a three-locus DNA barcode when applied to 296 species of woody trees, shrubs, and palms found within the 50-ha Forest Dynamics Plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, resulted in {\textgreater}98\% correct identifications. These DNA barcode sequences are also used to reconstruct a robust community phylogeny employing a supermatrix method for 281 of the 296 plant species in the plot. The three-locus barcode data were sufficient to reliably reconstruct evolutionary relationships among the plant taxa in the plot that are congruent with the broadly accepted phylogeny of flowering plants (APG II). Earlier work on the phylogenetic structure of the BCI forest dynamics plot employing less resolved phylogenies reveals significant differences in evolutionary and ecological inferences compared with our data and suggests that unresolved community phylogenies may have increased type I and type II errors. These results illustrate how highly resolved phylogenies based on DNA barcode sequence data will enhance research focused on the interface between community ecology and evolution.},

	abstract = {Genetic surveys reveal the diversity of bacteria and lead to the questioning of species concepts used to categorize bacteria. One difficulty in defining bacterial species arises from the high rates of recombination that results in the transfer of DNA between relatively distantly related bacteria. Barriers to this process, which could be used to define species naturally, are not apparent. Here, we review conceptual models of bacterial speciation and describe our computer simulations of speciation. Our findings suggest that the rate of recombination and its relation to genetic divergence have a strong influence on outcomes. We propose that a distinction be made between clonal divergence and sexual speciation. Hence, to make sense of bacterial diversity, we need data not only from genetic surveys but also from experimental determination of selection pressures and recombination rates and from theoretical models.},

	abstract = {In vitro studies of the haloarchaeal genus Haloferax have demonstrated their ability to frequently exchange DNA between species, whereas rates of homologous recombination estimated from natural populations in the genus Halorubrum are high enough to maintain random association of alleles between five loci. To quantify the effects of gene transfer and recombination of commonly held (relaxed core) genes during the evolution of the class Halobacteria (haloarchaea), we reconstructed the history of 21 genomes representing all major groups. Using a novel algorithm and a concatenated ribosomal protein phylogeny as a reference, we created a directed horizontal genetic transfer (HGT) network of contemporary and ancestral genomes. Gene order analysis revealed that90\% of testable HGTs were by direct homologous replacement, rather than nonhomologous integration followed by a loss. Network analysis revealed an inverse log-linear relationship between HGT frequency and ribosomal protein evolutionary distance that is maintained across the deepest divergences in Halobacteria. We use this mathematical relationship to estimate the total transfers and amino acid substitutions delivered by HGTs in each genome, providing a measure of chimerism. For the relaxed coregenes of each genome, we conservatively estimate that 11-20\% of their evolution occurred in other haloarchaea. Our findings are unexpected, because the transfer and homologous recombination of relaxed core genes between members of the class Halobacteria disrupts the coevolution of genes; however, the generation of new combinations of divergent but functionally related genes may lead to adaptive phenotypes not available through cumulative mutations and recombination within a single population. © 2012 The Author(s) .},

The traditional view, that prokaryotic evolution can be understood primarily in terms of clonal divergence and periodic selection, must be augmented to embrace gene exchange as a creative force, itself responsible for much of the pattern of similarities and differences we see between prokaryotic microbes. Rather than replacing periodic selection on genetic diversity, gene loss, and other chromosomal alterations as important players in adaptive evolution, gene exchange acts in concert with these processes to provide a rich explanatory paradigm - some of whose implications we explore here. In particular, we discuss (1) the role of recombination and HGT in giving phenotypic "coherence" to prokaryotic taxa at all levels of inclusiveness, (2) the implications of these processes for the reconstruction and meaning of "phylogeny," and (3) new views of prokaryotic adaptation and diversification based on gene acquisition and exchange.},

Comparing 31 newly sequenced and 134 previously sequenced bacterial isolates from cheese rinds, we identified over 200 putative horizontally transferred genomic regions containing 4733 protein coding genes. The largest of these regions are enriched for genes involved in siderophore acquisition, and are widely distributed in cheese rinds in both Europe and the US. These results suggest that HGT is prevalent in cheese rind microbiomes, and that identification of genes that are frequently transferred in a particular environment may provide insight into the selective forces shaping microbial communities.},

	abstract = {Dynamic programming algorithms guarantee to find the optimal alignment between two sequences. For more than a few sequences, exact algorithms become computationally impractical, and progressive algorithms iterating pain/vise alignments are widely used. These heuristic methods have a serious drawback because pain/vise algorithms do not differentiate insertions from deletions and end up penalizing single insertion events multiple times. Such an unrealistically high penalty for insertions typically results in overmatching of sequences and an underestimation of the number of insertion events. We describe a modification of the traditional alignment algorithm that can distinguish insertion from deletion and avoid repeated penalization of insertions and illustrate this method with a pair hidden Markov model that uses an evolutionary scoring function. In comparison with a traditional progressive alignment method, our algorithm infers a greater number of insertion events and creates gaps that are phylogenetically consistent but spatially less concentrated. Our results suggest that some insertion/deletion "hot spots" may actually be artifacts of traditional alignment algorithms. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Sequence-based methods for phylogenetic reconstruction from (nucleic acid) sequence data are notoriously plagued by two effects: homoplasies and alignment errors. Large evolutionary distances imply a large number of homoplastic sites. As most protein-coding genes show dramatic variations in substitution rates that are not uncorrelated across the sequence, this often leads to a patchwork pattern of (i) phylogenetically informative and (ii) effectively randomized regions. In highly variable regions, furthermore, alignment errors accumulate resulting in sometimes misleading signals in phylogenetic reconstruction. Results: We present here a method that, based on assessing the distribution of character states along a cyclic ordering of the taxa, allows the identification of phylogenetically uninformative homoplastic sites in a multiple sequence alignment. Removal of these sites appears to improve the performance of phylogenetic reconstruction algorithms as measured by various indices of "tree quality". In particular, we obtain more stable trees due to the exclusion of phylogenetically incompatible sites that most likely represent strongly randomized characters. Software: The computer program noisy implements this approach. It can be employed to improving phylogenetic reconstruction capability with quite a considerable success rate whenever (1) the average bootstrap support obtained from the original alignment is low, and (2) there are sufficiently many taxa in the data set - at least, say, 12 to 15 taxa.

	abstract = {The detection of positive Darwinian selection affecting protein-coding genes remains a topic of great interest and importance. The "branch- site" test is designed to detect localized episodic bouts of positive selection that affect only a few amino acid residues on particular lineages and has been shown to have reasonable power and low false-positive rates for a wide range of selection schemes. Previous simulations examining the performance of the test, however, were conducted under idealized conditions without insertions, deletions, or alignment errors. As the test is sometimes used to analyze divergent sequences, the impact of indels and alignment errors is a major concern. Here, we used a recently developed indel-simulation program to examine the false-positive rate and power of the branch-site test. We find that insertions and deletions do not cause excessive false positives if the alignment is correct, but alignment errors can lead to unacceptably high false positives. Of the alignment methods evaluated, PRANK consistently outperformed MUSCLE, MAFFT, and ClustalW, mostly because the latter programs tend to place nonhomologous codons (or amino acids) into the same column, producing shorter and less accurate alignments and giving the false impression that many amino acid substitutions have occurred at those sites. Our examination of two previous studies suggests that alignment errors may impact the analysis of mammalian and vertebrate genes by the branch-site test, and it is important to use reliable alignment methods. © 2010 The Author.},

	abstract = {Long-term dietary intake influences the structure and activity of the trillions of microorganisms residing in the human gut, but it remains unclear how rapidly and reproducibly the human gut microbiome responds to short-term macronutrient change. Here we show that the short-term consumption of diets composed entirely of animal or plant products alters microbial community structure and overwhelms inter-individual differences in microbial gene expression. The animal-based diet increased the abundance of bile-tolerant microorganisms (Alistipes, Bilophila and Bacteroides) and decreased the levels of Firmicutes that metabolize dietary plant polysaccharides (Roseburia, Eubacterium rectale and Ruminococcus bromii). Microbial activity mirrored differences between herbivorous and carnivorous mammals, reflecting trade-offs between carbohydrate and protein fermentation. Foodborne microbes from both diets transiently colonized the gut, including bacteria, fungi and even viruses. Finally, increases in the abundance and activity of Bilophila wadsworthia on the animal-based diet support a link between dietary fat, bile acids and the outgrowth of microorganisms capable of triggering inflammatory bowel disease. In concert, these results demonstrate that the gut microbiome can rapidly respond to altered diet, potentially facilitating the diversity of human dietary lifestyles. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Acetogens are chemolithoautotrophic bacteria that perform reductive carbon fixation under anaerobic conditions through the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway (WLP)/acetyl-coenzyme A pathway. The gene-encoding formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (FTHFS), a key enzyme of this pathway, is highly conserved and can be used as a molecular marker to probe acetogenic communities. However, there is a lack of systematic collection of FTHFS sequence data at nucleotide and protein levels. In an attempt to streamline investigations on acetogens, we developed AcetoBase - a repository and database for systematically collecting and organizing information related to FTHFS sequences. AcetoBase also provides an opportunity to submit data and obtain accession numbers, perform homology searches for sequence identification and access a customized blast database of submitted sequences. AcetoBase provides the prospect to identify potential acetogenic bacteria, based on metadata information related to genome content and the WLP, supplemented with FTHFS sequence accessions, and can be an important tool in the study of acetogenic communities.

Ten percent of the phylotypes were previously uncharacterized, including a Deinococcus-related organism, relatives of which have been found in extreme environments but not reported before in humans. The gastric clone libraries from 19 subjects contained H. pylori rDNA; however, only 12 of these subjects tested positive for H. pylori by conventional laboratory methods. Statistical analysis revealed a large degree of intersubject variability of the gastric ecosystem. The presence of H. pylori did not affect the composition of the gastric community. This gastric bacterial rDNA data set was significantly different from sequence collections of the human mouth and esophagus described in other studies, indicating that the human stomach may be home to a distinct microbial ecosystem. The gastric microbiota may play important as-yet-undiscovered roles in human health and disease. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

	abstract = {High-throughput amplicon sequencing of large genomic regions represents a challenge for existing short-read technologies. Long-read technologies can in theory sequence large genomic regions, but they currently suffer from high error rates. Here, we report a high-throughput amplicon sequencing approach that combines unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) with Oxford Nanopore sequencing to generate single-molecule consensus sequences of large genomic regions. We demonstrate the approach by generating nearly 10,000 full-length ribosomal RNA (rRNA) operons of roughly 4,400 bp in length from a mock microbial community consisting of eight bacterial species using a single Oxford Nanopore MinION flowcell. The mean error rate of the consensus sequences was 0.03\%, with no detectable chimeras due to a rigorous UMI-barcode filtering strategy. The simplicity and accessibility of this method paves way for widespread use of high-accuracy amplicon sequencing in a variety of genomic applications.},

	abstract = {Background \& Aims: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease affects up to 30\% of the US population, but the mechanisms underlying this condition are incompletely understood. We investigated how diet standardization and choline deficiency influence the composition of the microbial community in the human gastrointestinal tract and the development of fatty liver under conditions of choline deficiency. Methods: We performed a 2-month inpatient study of 15 female subjects who were placed on well-controlled diets in which choline levels were manipulated. We used 454-FLX pyrosequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA bacterial genes to characterize microbiota in stool samples collected over the course of the study. Results: The compositions of the gastrointestinal microbial communities changed with choline levels of diets; each individual's microbiome remained distinct for the duration of the experiment, even though all subjects were fed identical diets. Variations between subjects in levels of Gammaproteobacteria and Erysipelotrichi were directly associated with changes in liver fat in each subject during choline depletion. Levels of these bacteria, change in amount of liver fat, and a single nucleotide polymorphism that affects choline were combined into a model that accurately predicted the degree to which subjects developed fatty liver on a choline-deficient diet. Conclusions: Host factors and gastrointestinal bacteria each respond to dietary choline deficiency, although the gut microbiota remains distinct in each individual. We identified bacterial biomarkers of fatty liver that result from choline deficiency, adding to the accumulating evidence that gastrointestinal microbes have a role in metabolic disorders. © 2011 AGA Institute.},

	abstract = {In vertebrates, including humans, individuals harbor gut microbial communities whose species composition and relative proportions of dominant microbial groups are tremendously varied. Although external and stochastic factors clearly contribute to the individuality of the microbiota, the fundamental principles dictating how environmental factors and host genetic factors combine to shape this complex ecosystem are largely unknown and require systematic study. Here we examined factors that affect microbiota composition in a large (n = 645) mouse advanced intercross line originating from a cross between C57BL/6J and an ICR-derived outbred line (HR). Quantitative pyrosequencing of the microbiota defined a core measurable microbiota (CMM) of 64 conserved taxonomic groups that varied quantitatively across most animals in the population. Although some of this variation can be explained by litter and cohort effects, individual host genotype had a measurable contribution. Testing of the CMM abundances for cosegregation with 530 fully informative SNP markers identified 18 host quantitative trait loci (QTL) that show significant or suggestive genomewide linkage with relative abundances of specific microbial taxa. These QTL affect microbiota composition in three ways; some loci control individual microbial species, some control groups of related taxa, and some have putative pleiotropic effects on groups of distantly related organisms. These data provide clear evidence for the importance of host genetic control in shaping individual microbiome diversity in mammals, a key step toward understanding the factors that govern the assemblages of gut microbiota associated with complex diseases.},

We identified many microbial taxa whose abundances were influenced by host genetics. The most heritable taxon, the family Christensenellaceae, formed a co-occurrence network with other heritable Bacteria and with methanogenic Archaea. Furthermore, Christensenellaceae and its partners were enriched in individuals with low body mass index (BMI). An obese-associated microbiome was amended with Christensenella minuta, a cultured member of the Christensenellaceae, and transplanted to germ-free mice. C. minuta amendment reduced weight gain and altered the microbiome of recipient mice.

Benchmark metagenomes were generated from newly sequenced {\textasciitilde}700 microorganisms and {\textasciitilde}600 novel viruses and plasmids, including genomes with varying degrees of relatedness to each other and to publicly available ones and representing common experimental setups. Across all datasets, assembly and genome binning programs performed well for species represented by individual genomes, while performance was substantially affected by the presence of related strains. Taxonomic profiling and binning programs were proficient at high taxonomic ranks, with a notable performance decrease below the family level. Parameter settings substantially impacted performances, underscoring the importance of program reproducibility. While highlighting current challenges in computational metagenomics, the CAMI results provide a roadmap for software selection to answer specific research questions.},

Using this model, we derived formulae that enable us to estimate the evolutionary distances in terms of the number of nucleotide substitutions through comparative studies of nucleotide sequences. In order to check the validity of various formulae, Monte Carlo experiments were performed. These formulae were applied to analyze data on DNA sequences from diverse organisms. Particular attention was paid to problems concerning a globin pseudogene in the mouse and the time of its origin through duplication. We obtained a result suggesting that the evolutionary rates of substitution in the first and second codon positions of the pseudogene were roughly 10 times faster than those in the normal globin genes; whereas, the rate in the third position remained almost unchanged. Application of our formulae to histone genes H2B and H3 of the sea urchin showed that, in each of these genes, the rate in the third codon position is tremendously higher than that in the second position. All of these observations can easily and consistently be interpreted by the neutral theory of molecular evolution.},

High-throughput sequencing technology has facilitated in-depth studies of the gut microbiota, bacterial-derived metabolites, and their association with CMDs. Such strategies have shown that patients with CMDs frequently exhibit enrichment or depletion of certain bacterial groups in their resident microbiota compared to healthy individuals. Furthermore, the ability to transfer resident gut microbiota from mice or humans into germ-free mouse models, or between human patients, has enabled researchers to characterize the causative role of the gut microbiota in CMDs. These approaches have helped identify that dietary intake of choline, which is metabolized by the gut microbiota, is associated with cardiovascular outcomes in mice and humans. Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)-a metabolite derived from the gut microbiota-is also associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease and is elevated in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). TMAO might represent a biomarker that links the environment and microbiota with CKD. This Review summarizes data suggesting a link between the gut microbiota and derived metabolites with food intake patterns, metabolic alterations, and chronic CMDs.},

	abstract = {Although copious qualitative information describes the members of the diverse microbial communities on Earth, statistical approaches for quantifying and comparing the numbers and compositions of lineages in communities are lacking. We present a method that addresses the challenge of assigning sequences to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on the genetic distances between sequences. We developed a computer program, DOTUR, which assigns sequences to OTUs by using either the furthest, average, or nearest neighbor algorithm for each distance level. DOTUR uses the frequency at which each OTU is observed to construct rarefaction and collector's curves for various measures of richness and diversity. We analyzed 16S rRNA gene libraries derived from Scottish and Amazonian soils and the Sargasso Sea with DOTUR, which assigned sequences to OTUs rapidly and reliably based on the genetic distances between sequences and identified previous inconsistencies and errors in assigning sequences to OTUs. An analysis of the two 16S rRNA gene libraries from soil demonstrated that they do not contain enough sequences to support a claim that they contain different numbers of bacterial lineages with statistical confidence ( P {\textgreater} 0.05), nor do they contain enough sequences to provide a robust estimate of species richness when an OTU is defined as containing sequences that are no more than 3\% different from each other. In contrast, the richness of OTUs at the 3\% level in the Sargasso Sea collection began to plateau after the sampling of 690 sequences. We anticipate that an equivalent extent of sampling for soil would require sampling more than 10,000 sequences, almost 100 times the size of typical sequence collections obtained from soil.},

However, scaling laws developed for plants and animals often go untested or fail to hold for microorganisms. As a result, it is unclear whether scaling laws of biodiversity will span evolutionarily distant domains of life that encompass all modes of metabolism and scales of abundance. Using a global-scale compilation of ∼35,000 sites and ∼5.6⋅10 6 species, including the largest ever inventory of high-throughput molecular data and one of the largest compilations of plant and animal community data, we show similar rates of scaling in commonness and rarity across microorganisms and macroscopic plants and animals. We document a universal dominance scaling law that holds across 30 orders of magnitude, an unprecedented expanse that predicts the abundance of dominant ocean bacteria. In combining this scaling law with the lognormal model of biodiversity, we predict that Earth is home to upward of 1 trillion (10 12 ) microbial species. Microbial biodiversity seems greater than ever anticipated yet predictable from the smallest to the largest microbiome.},

Its main purpose is to facilitate the reusability and accessibility of the rapidly growing human metagenomic data. This is achieved by consistently annotating the microbial contents of collected samples using state-of-art toolsets and by manual curation of the meta-data of the corresponding human hosts. GMrepo organizes the collected samples according to their associated phenotypes and includes all possible related meta-data such as age, sex, country, body-mass-index (BMI) and recent antibiotics usage. To make relevant information easier to access, GMrepo is equipped with a graphical query builder, enabling users to make customized, complex and biologically relevant queries. For example, to find (1) samples from healthy individuals of 18 to 25 years old with BMIs between 18.5 and 24.9, or (2) projects that are related to colorectal neoplasms, with each containing \&gt;100 samples and both patients and healthy controls. Precomputed species/genus relative abundances, prevalence within and across phenotypes, and pairwise co-occurrence information are all available at the website and accessible through programmable interfaces. So far, GMrepo contains 58 903 human gut samples/runs (including 17 618 metagenomes and 41 285 amplicons) from 253 projects concerning 92 phenotypes.

	issn = {14712105},
	doi = {10.1186/s12859-015-0788-5},
	abstract = {Background: The field of metagenomics (study of genetic material recovered directly from an environment) has grown rapidly, with many bioinformatics analysis methods being developed. To ensure appropriate use of such methods, robust comparative evaluation of their accuracy and features is needed. For taxonomic classification of sequence reads, such evaluation should include use of clade exclusion, which better evaluates a method's accuracy when identical sequences are not present in any reference database, as is common in metagenomic analysis. To date, relatively small evaluations have been performed, with evaluation approaches like clade exclusion limited to assessment of new methods by the authors of the given method. What is needed is a rigorous, independent comparison between multiple major methods, using the same in silico and in vitro test datasets, with and without approaches like clade exclusion, to better characterize accuracy under different conditions. Results: An overview of the features of 38 bioinformatics methods is provided, evaluating accuracy with a focus on 11 programs that have reference databases that can be modified and therefore most robustly evaluated with clade exclusion. Taxonomic classification of sequence reads was evaluated using both in silico and in vitro mock bacterial communities. Clade exclusion was used at taxonomic levels from species to class-identifying how well methods perform in progressively more difficult scenarios. A wide range of variability was found in the sensitivity, precision, overall accuracy, and computational demand for the programs evaluated. In experiments where distilled water was spiked with only 11 bacterial species, frequently dozens to hundreds of species were falsely predicted by the most popular programs. The different features of each method (forces predictions or not, etc.) are summarized, and additional analysis considerations discussed. Conclusions: The accuracy of shotgun metagenomics classification methods varies widely. No one program clearly outperformed others in all evaluation scenarios; rather, the results illustrate the strengths of different methods for different purposes. Researchers must appreciate method differences, choosing the program best suited for their particular analysis to avoid very misleading results. Use of standardized datasets for method comparisons is encouraged, as is use of mock microbial community controls suitable for a particular metagenomic analysis.},

However, this procedure is hindered by the lack of a well-curated taxonomic tree for newly discovered species, which is required by current metagenomics tools. Here we report DeepMicrobes, a deep learning-based computational framework for taxonomic classification that allows researchers to bypass this limitation. We show the advantage of DeepMicrobes over state-of-the-art tools in species and genus identification and comparable accuracy in abundance estimation. We trained DeepMicrobes on genomes reconstructed from gut microbiomes and discovered potential novel signatures in inflammatory bowel diseases.

	abstract = {The reconstruction of the Tree of Life has relied almost entirely on concatenation methods, which do not accommodate gene tree heterogeneity, a property that simulations and theory have identified as a likely cause of incongruent phylogenies. However, this incongruence has not yet been demonstrated in empirical studies. Several key relationships among eutherian mammals remain controversial and conflicting among previous studies, including the root of eutherian tree and the relationships within Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria. Both bayesian and maximum-likelihood analysis of genome-wide data of 447 nuclear genes from 37 species show that concatenation methods indeed yield strong incongruence in the phylogeny of eutherian mammals, as revealed by subsampling analyses of loci and taxa, which produced strongly conflicting topologies. In contrast, the coalescent methods, which accommodate gene tree heterogeneity, yield a phylogeny that is robust to variable gene and taxon sampling and is congruent with geographic data. The data also demonstrate that incomplete lineage sorting, a major source of gene tree heterogeneity, is relevant to deep-level phylogenies, such as those among eutherian mammals. Our results firmly place the eutherian root between Atlantogenata and Boreoeutheria and support ungulate polyphyly and a sister-group relationship between Scandentia and Primates. This study demonstrates that the incongruence introduced by concatenation methods is a major cause of long-standing uncertainty in the phylogeny of eutherian mammals, and the same may apply to other clades. Our analyses suggest that such incongruence can be resolved using phylogenomic data and coalescent methods that deal explicitly with gene tree heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) is a relatively new method used to determine the differences in the genetic makeup of individuals. Its novelty stems from a combination of two already available methods: genotyping and next-generation sequencing. Depending on the individual study design GBS protocols can take multiple forms, however most share a sequence of core steps that have to be undertaken. These include: sequencing of the DNA from the individuals of interest (usually two parents of a mapping population and their progeny), mapping of the sequencing reads to the reference sequence, SNP calling and filtering, SNP genotyping and imputation, followed by haplotype identification and downstream analysis. GBS has a range of applications from general marker discovery, haplotype identification, and recombination characterization to quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and genomic selection (GS). It has already been applied to a range of plant species including: rice, maize, artichoke, and Arabidopsis thaliana. It is a promising approach which is likely to provide new and important insights into plant biology.},

	abstract = {Studies on foraging partitioning in pollinators can provide critical information to the understanding of food-web niche and pollination functions, thus aiding conservation. Metabarcoding based on PCR amplification and high-throughput sequencing has seen increasing applications in characterizing pollen loads carried by pollinators. However, amplification bias across taxa could lead to unpredictable artefacts in estimation of pollen compositions. We examined the efficacy of a genome-skimming method based on direct shotgun sequencing in quantifying mixed pollen, using mock samples (five and 14 mocks of flower and bee pollen, respectively). The results demonstrated a high level of repeatability and accuracy in identifying pollen from mixtures of varied species ratios. All pollen species were detected in all mocks, and pollen frequencies estimated from the number of sequence reads of each species were significantly correlated with pollen count proportions (linear model, R2 = 86.7\%, p = 2.2e−16). For {\textgreater}97\% of the mixed taxa, pollen proportion could be quantified by sequencing to the correct order of magnitude, even for species which constituted only 0.2\% of the total pollen. In addition, DNA extracted from pollen grains equivalent to those collected from a single honeybee corbicula was sufficient for genome-skimming. We conclude that genome-skimming is a feasible approach to identifying and quantifying mixed pollen samples. By providing reliable and sensitive taxon identification and relative abundance, this method is expected to improve our understanding in studies that involve plant–pollinator interactions, such as pollen preference in corbiculate bees, pollen diet analyses and identification of landscape pollen resource use from beehives.},

We assembled a database representing approximately 43\% of the circa 260 globally known species, which included species extinction risk assessments following the International Union fo Conservation of Nature Red List categories and criteria, and information on species traits presumably associated with bumblebee decline. We quantified the strength of phylogenetic signal in decline, range size, tongue length and parasite presence. Overall, about one-third of the assessed bumblebees are declining and declining species are not randomly distributed across the Bombus phylogeny. Susceptible species were over-represented in the subgenus Thoracobombus (approx. 64\%) and under-represented in the subgenus Pyrobombus (approx. 6\%). Phylogenetic logistic regressions revealed that species with small geographical ranges and those in which none of three internal parasites were reported (i.e. Crithidia bombi, Nosema spp. or Locustacarus buchneri) were particularly vulnerable. Bumblebee evolutionary history will be deeply eroded if most species from threatened clades, particularly those stemming from basal nodes, become finally extinct. The habitat of species with restricted distribution should be protected and the importance of pathogen tolerance/ resistance as mechanisms to deal with pathogens needs urgent research.},

	abstract = {Many aspects of morphological phylogenetics are controversial in the theoretical systematics literature and yet are often poorly explained and justified in empirical studies. In this paper, I argue that most morphological characters describe variation that is fundamentally quantitative, regardless of whether they are coded qualitatively or quantitatively by systematists. Given this view, three fundamental problems in morphological character analysis (definition, delimitation, and ordering of character states) may have a common solution: coding morphological characters as continuous quantitative traits. A new parsimony method (step-matrix gap-weighting, a modification of Thiele's approach) is proposed that allows quantitative traits to be analyzed as continuous variables. The problem of scaling or weighting quantitative characters relative to qualitative characters (and to each other) is reviewed, and three possible solutions are described. The new coding method is applied to data from hoplocercid lizards, and the results show the sensitivity of phylogenetic conclusions to different scaling methods. Although some authors reject the use of continuous, overlapping, quantitative characters in phylogenetic analysis, quantitative data from hoplocercid lizards that are coded using the new approach contain significant phylogenetic structure and exhibit levels of homoplasy similar to those seen in data that are coded qualitatively.},

	abstract = {This review is motivated by the true explosion in the number of recent studies both developing and ameliorating probabilistic models of codon evolution. Traditionally parametric, the first codon models focused on estimating the effects of selective pressure on the protein via an explicit parameter in the maximum likelihood framework. Likelihood ratio tests of nested codon models armed the biologists with powerful tools, which provided unambiguous evidence for positive selection in real data. This, in turn, triggered a new wave of methodological developments. The new generation of models views the codon evolution process in a more sophisticated way, relaxing several mathematical assumptions. These models make a greater use of physicochemical amino acid properties, genetic code machinery, and the large amounts of data from the public domain. The overview of the most recent advances on modeling codon evolution is presented here, and a wide range of their applications to real data is discussed. On the downside, availability of a large variety of models, each accounting for various biological factors, increases the margin for misinterpretation; the biological meaning of certain parameters may vary among models, and model selection procedures also deserve greater attention. Solid understanding of the modeling assumptions and their applicability is essential for successful statistical data analysis. © The Author 2008.

	abstract = {Codon-based substitution models have been widely used to identify amino acid sites under positive selection in comparative analysis of protein-coding DNA sequences. The nonsynonymous-synonymous substitution rate ratio (d N/dS, denoted ω) is used as a measure of selective pressure at the protein level, with ω {\textgreater} 1 indicating positive selection. Statistical distributions are used to model the variation in ω among sites, allowing a subset of sites to have ω {\textgreater} 1 while the rest of the sequence may be under purifying selection with ω {\textless} 1. An empirical Bayes (EB) approach is then used to calculate posterior probabilities that a site comes from the site class with ω {\textgreater} 1. Current implementations, however, use the naive EB (NEB) approach and fail to account for sampling errors in maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters, such as the proportions and ω ratios for the site classes. In small data sets lacking information, this approach may lead to unreliable posterior probability calculations. In this paper, we develop a Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) approach to the problem, which assigns a prior to the model parameters and integrates over their uncertainties. We compare the new and old methods on real and simulated data sets. The results suggest that in small data sets the new BEB method does not generate false positives as did the old NEB approach, while in large data sets it retains the good power of the NEB approach for inferring positively selected sites. © Society for MBE 2005; all rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The question is often raised whether it is statistically necessary to control for phylogenetic associations in comparative studies. To investigate this question, we explore the use of a measure of phylogenetic correlation, λ, introduced by Pagel (1999), that normally varies between 0 (phylogenetic independence) and 1 (species' traits covary in direct proportion to their shared evolutionary history). Simulations show λ to be a statistically powerful index for measuring whether data exhibit phylogenetic dependence or not and whether it has low rates of Type I error. Moreover, λ is robust to incomplete phylogenetic information, which demonstrates that even partial information on phylogeny will improve the accuracy of phylogenetic analyses. To assess whether traits generally show phylogenetic associations, we present a quantitative review of 26 published phylogenetic comparative data sets. The data sets include 103 traits and were chosen from the ecological literature in which debate about the need for phylogenetic correction has been most acute. Eighty-eight percent of data sets contained at least one character that displayed significant phylogenetic dependence, and 60\% of characters overall (pooled across studies) showed significant evidence of phylogenetic association. In 16\% of tests, phylogenetic correlation could be neither supported nor rejected. However, most of these equivocal results were found in small phylogenies and probably reflect a lack of power. We suggest that the parameter λ be routinely estimated when analyzing comparative data, since it can also be used simultaneously to adjust the phylogenetic correction in a manner that is optimal for the data set, and we present an example of how this may be done.},

	abstract = {Niche differences are key to understanding the distribution and structure of biodiversity. To examine niche differences, we must first characterize how species occupy niche space, and two approaches are commonly used in the ecological literature. The first uses species traits to estimate multivariate trait space (so-called functional trait diversity, FD); the second quantifies the amount of time or evolutionary history captured by a group of species (phylogenetic diversity, PD). It is often—but controversially—assumed that these putative measures of niche space are at a minimum correlated and perhaps redundant, since more evolutionary time allows for greater accumulation of trait changes. This theoretical expectation remains surprisingly poorly evaluated, particularly in the context of multivariate measures of trait diversity. We evaluated the relationship between phylogenetic diversity and trait diversity using analytical and simulation-based methods across common models of trait evolution. We show that PD correlates with FD increasingly strongly as more traits are included in the FD measure. Our results indicate that phylogenetic diversity can be a useful surrogate for high-dimensional trait diversity, but we also show that the correlation weakens when the underlying process of trait evolution includes variation in rate and optima.},

Several definitions of consensus exist in the literature; in this paper we focus on the Weighted Quartet Consensus problem, a problem with unknown complexity status so far. Here we prove that the Weighted Quartet Consensus problem is NP-hard and we give a 1/2-factor approximation for this problem.

Careful analysis of available data allows strategic augmentation with new sequences in order to maximize taxonomic sampling and coverage of informative loci. I inferred relationships among 179 species (76\%) in the avian family Picidae (woodpeckers, piculets, and wrynecks), using publicly available sequence data supplemented with targeted sequencing to increase species-level and locus-level sampling and maximize resolution. Results of these analyses generally corroborate previous molecular studies, with consensus on the membership of most genera and tribes. However, several newly placed taxa show surprising affinities, and several genera as currently delineated appear to be paraphyletic. Relationships among major clades of Picidae remain poorly resolved, particularly among the three lineages of piculets, the unusual woodpecker genus Hemicircus, and the remaining woodpeckers, and among the major groups of true woodpeckers (Picinae). If these deep relationships are to be resolved, phylogenomic approaches may be necessary.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Several applications in bioinformatics, such as genome assemblers and error corrections methods, rely on counting and keeping track of k-mers (substrings of length k). Histograms of k-mer frequencies can give valuable insight into the underlying distribution and indicate the error rate and genome size sampled in the sequencing experiment. Results: We present KmerStream, a streaming algorithm for estimating the number of distinct k-mers present in high-throughput sequencing data. The algorithm runs in time linear in the size of the input and the space requirement are logarithmic in the size of the input. We derive a simple model that allows us to estimate the error rate of the sequencing experiment, as well as the genome size, using only the aggregate statistics reported by KmerStream. As an application we show how KmerStream can be used to compute the error rate of a DNA sequencing experiment. We run KmerStream on a set of 2656 whole genome sequenced individuals and compare the error rate to quality values reported by the sequencing equipment. We discover that while the quality values alone are largely reliable as a predictor of error rate, there is considerable variability in the error rates between sequencing runs, even when accounting for reported quality values.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION The BLAST software package for sequence comparison speeds up homology search by preprocessing a query sequence into a lookup table. Numerous research studies have suggested that preprocessing the database instead would give better performance. However, production usage of sequence comparison methods that preprocess the database has been limited to programs such as BLAT and SSAHA that are designed to find matches when query and database subsequences are highly similar. RESULTS We developed a new version of the MegaBLAST module of BLAST that does the initial phase of finding short seeds for matches by searching a database index. We also developed a program makembindex that preprocesses the database into a data structure for rapid seed searching. We show that the new 'indexed MegaBLAST' is faster than the 'non-indexed' version for most practical uses. We show that indexed MegaBLAST is faster than miBLAST, another implementation of BLAST nucleotide searching with a preprocessed database, for most of the 200 queries we tested. To deploy indexed MegaBLAST as part of NCBI'sWeb BLAST service, the storage of databases and the queueing mechanism were modified, so that some machines are now dedicated to serving queries for a specific database. The response time for such Web queries is now faster than it was when each computer handled queries for multiple databases. AVAILABILITY The code for indexed MegaBLAST is part of the blastn program in the NCBI C++ toolkit. The preprocessor program makembindex is also in the toolkit. Indexed MegaBLAST has been used in production on NCBI's Web BLAST service to search one version of the human and mouse genomes since October 2007. The Linux command-line executables for blastn and makembindex, documentation, and some query sets used to carry out the tests described below are available in the directory: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/agarwala/indexed\_megablast [corrected] SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Here we present the novel metagenome classifier Kaiju, which finds maximum (in-)exact matches on the protein-level using the Burrows-Wheeler transform. We show in a genome exclusion benchmark that Kaiju classifies reads with higher sensitivity and similar precision compared with current k-mer-based classifiers, especially in genera that are underrepresented in reference databases. We also demonstrate that Kaiju classifies up to 10 times more reads in real metagenomes. Kaiju can process millions of reads per minute and can run on a standard PC.

Here we describe how to circumvent such pitfalls, and develop a protocol for creating more faithful t-SNE visualisations. It includes PCA initialisation, a high learning rate, and multi-scale similarity kernels; for very large data sets, we additionally use exaggeration and downsampling-based initialisation.

	doi = {10.1186/gb-2005-6-3-r23},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Trace Archive is a repository for the raw, unanalyzed data generated by large-scale genome sequencing projects. The existence of this data offers scientists the possibility of discovering additional genomic sequences beyond those originally sequenced. In particular, if the source DNA for a sequencing project came from a species that was colonized by another organism, then the project may yield substantial amounts of genomic DNA, including near-complete genomes, from the symbiotic or parasitic organism. RESULTS: By searching the publicly available repository of DNA sequencing trace data, we discovered three new species of the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis in three different species of fruit fly: Drosophila ananassae, D. simulans, and D. mojavensis. We extracted all sequences with partial matches to a previously sequenced Wolbachia strain and assembled those sequences using customized software. For one of the three new species, the data recovered were sufficient to produce an assembly that covers more than 95\% of the genome; for a second species the data produce the equivalent of a 'light shotgun' sampling of the genome, covering an estimated 75-80\% of the genome; and for the third species the data cover approximately 6-7\% of the genome. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study reveal an unexpected benefit of depositing raw data in a central genome sequence repository: new species can be discovered within this data. The differences between these three new Wolbachia genomes and the previously sequenced strain revealed numerous rearrangements and insertions within each lineage and hundreds of novel genes. The three new genomes, with annotation, have been deposited in GenBank.},

One criticism of the approach is an inability to validate its algorithms within a biological context as opposed to a computer simulation.

The evolved phylogeny consists of 19 operational taxonomic units (leaves) and 17 ancestral bifurcations (nodes) that display a wide variety of fluorescent phenotypes. The 19 leaves then serve as 'modern' sequences that we subject to ASR analyses using various algorithms and to benchmark against the known ancestral genotypes and ancestral phenotypes. We confirm computer simulations that show all algorithms infer ancient sequences with high accuracy, yet we also reveal wide variation in the phenotypes encoded by incorrectly inferred sequences. Specifically, Bayesian methods incorporating rate variation significantly outperform the maximum parsimony criterion in phenotypic accuracy. Subsampling of extant sequences had minor effect on the inference of ancestral sequences.},

Standard Johnson-Lindenstrauss dimensionality reduction does not produce data visualizations. The t-SNE heuristic of van der Maaten and Hinton, which is based on non-convex optimization, has become the de facto standard for visualization in a wide range of applications. This work gives a formal framework for the problem of data visualization - finding a 2-dimensional embedding of clusterable data that correctly separates individual clusters to make them visually identifiable. We then give a rigorous analysis of the performance of t-SNE under a natural, deterministic condition on the "ground-truth" clusters (similar to conditions assumed in earlier analyses of clustering) in the underlying data. These are the first provable guarantees on t-SNE for constructing good data visualizations. We show that our deterministic condition is satisfied by considerably general probabilistic generative models for clusterable data such as mixtures of well-separated log-concave distributions. Finally, we give theoretical evidence that t-SNE provably succeeds in partially recovering cluster structure even when the above deterministic condition is not met.},

	abstract = {Metagenomics uses nucleic acid sequencing to characterize species diversity in different niches such as environmental biomes or the human microbiome. Most studies have used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to identify bacteria. However, the decreasing cost of sequencing has resulted in a gradual shift away from amplicon analyses and towards shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Shotgun metagenomic data can be used to identify a wide range of species, but have rarely been applied to fungal identification. Here, we develop a sequence classification pipeline, FindFungi, and use it to identify fungal sequences in public metagenome datasets. We focus primarily on animal metagenomes, especially those from pig and mouse microbiomes. We identified fungi in 39 of 70 datasets comprising 71 fungal species. At least 11 pathogenic species with zoonotic potential were identified, including Candida tropicalis. We identified Pseudogymnoascus species from 13 Antarctic soil samples initially analyzed for the presence of bacteria capable of degrading diesel oil. We also show that Candida tropicalis and Candida loboi are likely the same species. In addition, we identify several examples where contaminating DNA was erroneously included in fungal genome assemblies.},

It is also a crucial task as it guides many other tasks like phylogenetic analysis, function, and/or structure prediction of biological macromolecules like DNA, RNA, and Protein. Proteins are the building blocks of every living organism. Although protein alignment problem has been studied for several decades, unfortunately, every available method produces alignment results differently for a single alignment problem. Multiple sequence alignment is characterized as a very high computational complex problem. Many stochastic methods, therefore, are considered for improving the accuracy of alignment. Among them, many researchers frequently use Genetic Algorithm. In this study, we have shown different types of the method applied in alignment and the recent trends in the multiobjective genetic algorithm for solving multiple sequence alignment. Many recent studies have demonstrated considerable progress in finding the alignment accuracy.},

One potential confounder of these sequence-based approaches is the presence of contamination in DNA extraction kits and other laboratory reagents. RESULTS: In this study we demonstrate that contaminating DNA is ubiquitous in commonly used DNA extraction kits and other laboratory reagents, varies greatly in composition between different kits and kit batches, and that this contamination critically impacts results obtained from samples containing a low microbial biomass. Contamination impacts both PCR-based 16S rRNA gene surveys and shotgun metagenomics. We provide an extensive list of potential contaminating genera, and guidelines on how to mitigate the effects of contamination. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that caution should be advised when applying sequence-based techniques to the study of microbiota present in low biomass environments. Concurrent sequencing of negative control samples is strongly advised.},

It provides a standard interface for measuring the performance and quality achieved by nearest neighbor algorithms on different standard data sets. It supports several different ways of integrating k-NN algorithms, and its configuration system automatically tests a range of parameter settings for each algorithm. Algorithms are compared with respect to many different (approximate) quality measures, and adding more is easy and fast; the included plotting front-ends can visualise these as images, plots, and websites with interactive plots. ANN-Benchmarks aims to provide a constantly updated overview of the current state of the art of k-NN algorithms. In the short term, this overview allows users to choose the correct k-NN algorithm and parameters for their similarity search task; in the longer term, algorithm designers will be able to use this overview to test and refine automatic parameter tuning. The paper gives an overview of the system, evaluates the results of the benchmark, and points out directions for future work. Interestingly, very different approaches to k-NN search yield comparable quality-performance trade-offs. The system is available at http://sss.projects.itu.dk/ann-benchmarks/.},

First, the new rule is symmetric with respect to reversing the sequence. Second, the new rule is not context sensitive; the decision to mask a subsequence does not depend on what sequences flank it. The new implementation is at least four times faster than the old on the human genome. We show that both the percentage of additional bases masked and the effect on MegaBLAST outputs are very small.},

Although many algorithms have been developed to date, they suffer significant memory and/or computational costs. Due to the growing popularity of metagenomic data in both basic science and clinical applications, as well as the increasing volume of data being generated, efficient and accurate algorithms are in high demand. Results: We introduce MetaOthello, a probabilistic hashing classifier for metagenomic sequencing reads. The algorithm employs a novel data structure, called l-Othello, to support efficient querying of a taxon using its k-mer signatures. MetaOthello is an order-of-magnitude faster than the current state-of-the-art algorithms Kraken and Clark, and requires only one-third of the RAM. In comparison to Kaiju, a metagenomic classification tool using protein sequences instead of genomic sequences, MetaOthello is three times faster and exhibits 20-30\% higher classification sensitivity. We report comparative analyses of both scalability and accuracy using a number of simulated and empirical datasets.

We independently sequenced the genome of H. dujardini As expected from whole-organism DNA sampling, our raw data contained reads from nontarget genomes. Filtering using metagenomics approaches generated a draft H. dujardini genome assembly of 135 Mb with superior assembly metrics to the previously published assembly. Additional microbial contamination likely remains. We found no support for extensive fHGT. Among 23,021 gene predictions we identified 0.2\% strong candidates for fHGT from bacteria and 0.2\% strong candidates for fHGT from nonmetazoan eukaryotes. Cross-comparison of assemblies showed that the overwhelming majority of HGT candidates in the Boothby et al. genome derived from contaminants. We conclude that fHGT into H. dujardini accounts for at most 1-2\% of genes and that the proposal that one-sixth of tardigrade genes originate from functional HGT events is an artifact of undetected contamination.},

The presence of non-human sequences in these catalogues can inflate the number of “novel” human sequences, overestimate the genetic differentiation among populations, and jeopardize subsequent analyses that rely on these resources. We uncovered almost 2,000 contaminant sequences of microbial origin in NRNR sequences from recent human pan-genome studies. The contaminant contigs (3,501,302 bp) harbour genes totalling 4,720 predicted proteins (\&gt;40 aa). The major sources of contamination are related to Rhyzobiales, Burkholderiales, Pseudomonadales and Lactobacillales, which may have been associated with the original samples or introduced later during sequencing experiments. We additionally observed that the majority of human novel protein-coding genes described in one of the studies entirely overlap repetitive regions and are likely to be false positive predictions.

We challenge the universality of this traditional view in this report of genes encoding enzymes for the shikimate pathway in an animal, the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. Molecular evidence establishes horizontal transfer of ancestral genes of the shikimic acid pathway into the N. vectensis genome from both bacterial and eukaryotic (dinoflagellate) donors. Bioinformatic analysis also reveals four genes that are closely related to those of Tenacibaculum sp. MED152, raising speculation for the existence of a previously unsuspected bacterial symbiont. Indeed, the genome of the holobiont (i.e., the entity consisting of the host and its symbionts) comprises a high content of Tenacibaculum-like gene orthologs, including a 16S rRNA sequence that establishes the phylogenetic position of this associate to be within the family Flavobacteriaceae. These results provide a complementary view for the biogenesis of shikimate-related metabolites in marine Cnidaria as a "shared metabolic adaptation" between the partners.},

As samples or genomes are added to the cdbg, the color information comes to dominate the space required to represent this data structure. In this paper, we show how to represent the color information efficiently by adopting a hierarchical encoding that exploits correlations among color classes — patterns of color occurrence — present in the de Bruijn graph (dbg). A major challenge in deriving an efficient encoding of the color information that takes advantage of such correlations is determining which color classes are close to each other in the high-dimensional space of possible color patterns. We demonstrate that the dbg itself can be used as an efficient mechanism to search for approximate nearest neighbors in this space. While our approach reduces the encoding size of the color information even for relatively small cdbgs (hundreds of experiments), the gains are particularly consequential as the number of potential colors (i.e. samples or references) grows to thousands of experiments. We apply this encoding in the context of two different applications; the implicit cdbg used for a large-scale sequence search index, Mantis, as well as the encoding of color information used in population-level variation detection by tools such as Vari and Rainbowfish. Our results show significant improvements in the overall size and scalability of representation of the color information. In our experiment on 10,000 samples, we achieved more than 11 × better compression compared to RRR.},

One explanation for such sequence affinities could be that these genes have been horizontally transferred from bacteria to the Nematostella lineage. We show, however, that bacterium-like and phage-like genes sequenced by the N. vectensis genome project tend to cluster on separate scaffolds, which typically do not include eukaryotic genes and differ from the latter in their GC contents. Moreover, most of the bacterium-like genes in N. vectensis either lack introns or the introns annotated in such genes are false predictions that, when translated, often restore the missing portions of their predicted protein products. In a freshwater cnidarian, Hydra, for which a proteobacterial endosymbiont is known, these gene features have been used to delineate the DNA of that endosymbiont sampled by the genome sequencing project. We predict that a large fraction of bacterium-like genes identified in the N. vectensis genome similarly are drawn from the contemporary bacterial consorts of the starlet sea anemone. These uncharacterized bacteria associated with N. vectensis are a proteobacterium and a representative of the phylum Bacteroidetes, each represented in the database by an apparently random sample of informational and operational genes. A substantial portion of a putative bacteriophage genome was also detected, which would be especially unlikely to have been transferred to a eukaryote.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Contamination is a well-known but often neglected problem in molecular biology. Here, we investigated the prevalence of cross-contamination among 446 samples from 116 distinct species of animals, which were processed in the same laboratory and subjected to subcontracted transcriptome sequencing. RESULTS: Using cytochrome oxidase 1 as a barcode, we identified a minimum of 782 events of between-species contamination, with approximately 80\% of our samples being affected. An analysis of laboratory metadata revealed a strong effect of the sequencing center: nearly all the detected events of between-species contamination involved species that were sent the same day to the same company. We introduce new methods to address the amount of within-species, between-individual contamination, and to correct for this problem when calling genotypes from base read counts. CONCLUSIONS: We report evidence for pervasive within-species contamination in this data set, and show that classical population genomic statistics, such as synonymous diversity, the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous diversity, inbreeding coefficient F(IT), and Tajima's D, are sensitive to this problem to various extents. Control analyses suggest that our published results are probably robust to the problem of contamination. Recommendations on how to prevent or avoid contamination in large-scale population genomics/molecular ecology are provided based on this analysis.},

Much work has been done to improve methods for this task, particularly for the alignment of small sequences, and especially for amino acid sequences. However, less work has been done in making promising methods that work on the small-scale practically for the alignment of much larger genomic sequences.Results: We take the method of probabilistic consistency alignment and make it practical for the alignment of large genomic sequences. In so doing we develop a set of new technical methods, combined in a framework we term ‘sequence progressive alignment', because it allows us to iteratively compute an alignment by passing over the input sequences from left to right. The result is that we massively decrease the memory consumption of the program relative to a naive implementation. The general engineering of the challenges faced in scaling such a computationally intensive process offer valuable lessons for planning related large-scale sequence analysis algorithms. We also further show the strong performance of Pecan using an extended analysis of ancient repeat alignments. Pecan is now one of the default alignment programs that has and is being used by a number of whole-genome comparative genomic projects.Availability: The Pecan program is freely available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/∼bjp/pecan/ Pecan whole genome alignments can be found in the Ensembl genome browser.Contact:benedict@soe.ucsc.edusupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic tree inference is a critical component of many systematic and evolutionary studies. The majority of these studies are based on the two-step process of multiple sequence alignment followed by tree inference, despite persistent evidence that the alignment step can lead to biased results. Here we present a two-part study that first presents PaHMM-Tree, a novel neighbor joining-based method that estimates pairwise distances without assuming a single alignment. We then use simulations to benchmark its performance against a wide-range of other phylogenetic tree inference methods, including the first comparison of alignment-free distance-based methods against more conventional tree estimation methods. Our new method for calculating pairwise distances based on statistical alignment provides distance estimates that are as accurate as those obtained using standard methods based on the true alignment. Pairwise distance estimates based on the two-step process tend to be substantially less accurate. This improved performance carries through to tree inference, where PaHMM-Tree provides more accurate tree estimates than all of the pairwise distance methods assessed. For close to moderately divergent sequence data we find that the two-step methods using statistical inference, where information from all sequences is included in the estimation procedure, tend to perform better than PaHMM-Tree, particularly full statistical alignment, which simultaneously estimates both the tree and the alignment. For deep divergences we find the alignment step becomes so prone to error that our distance-based PaHMM-Tree outperforms all other methods of tree inference. Finally, we find that the accuracy of alignment-free methods tends to decline faster than standard two-step methods in the presence of alignment uncertainty, and identify no conditions where alignment-free methods are equal to or more accurate than standard phylogenetic methods even in the presence of substantial alignment error.},

We show that the number of substitutions per site that occurred since two sequences evolved from their last common ancestor, can be estimated from the slope of a certain function of Nk . This approach can be generalized from contiguous word matches to so-called spaced-word matches, where mismatches are allowed at certain pre-defined positions. Based on these theoretical results, we implemented a software program for alignment-free sequence comparison called Slope-SpaM . Test runs on simulated sequence data show that Slope-SpaM can accurately estimate phylogenetic distances for distance values up to around 0.5 substitutions per position. The statistical stability of our results is improved if spaced words are used instead of contiguous words. Unlike previous methods that are based on the number of (spaced) word matches, Slope-SpaM produces accurate results, even if sequences share only local homologies.

We present MetaFlow, the first method based on coverage analysis across entire genomes that also scales to HTS samples. We formulated this problem as an NP-hard matching problem in a bipartite graph, which we solved in practice by min-cost flows. On synthetic data sets of varying complexity and similarity, MetaFlow is more precise and sensitive than popular tools such as MetaPhlAn, mOTU, GSMer and BLAST, and its abundance estimations at species level are two to four times better in terms of L1-norm. On a real human stool data set, MetaFlow identifies B.uniformis as most predominant, in line with previous human gut studies, whereas marker-based methods report it as rare.

A total of 121 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) coding regions from 14 different groups of bacteria, algae and plants, available in the Gene Bank/European Molecular Biology Laboratory databases, were aligned and several conserved DNA sequences of bacterial origin were identified. From those, five degenerated primers were designed in order to amplify only the bacterial DNA present in mixed plant/bacteria genomic DNA extracts. A known amount of bacterial suspension of either covert Pseudomonas or covert Bacillus were added to in vitro plant leaves and total plant/bacterial DNA extracted using three different methods to determine the lowest number of bacteria required to be present in order to allow their detection. The highest sensitivity of the bacterial cell detection was 2.5 × 10(6) cells of both Bacillus and Pseudomonas inoculums, using template DNA prepared by the MiniPrep method. Generation of PCR amplification fragments was achieved only for the 16S rDNA bacterial gene by using four combinations of degenerated primers. Successive sequence analysis of these amplified fragments led to the rapid detection and molecular identification of bacteria covertly associated with plants.},

A fundamental computational problem in this context is read classification, i.e. the assignment of each read to a taxonomic label. Due to the large number of reads produced by modern high-throughput sequencing technologies and the rapidly increasing number of available reference genomes corresponding software tools suffer from either long runtimes, large memory requirements or low accuracy. Results: We introduce MetaCache-a novel software for read classification using the big data technique minhashing. Our approach performs context-aware classification of reads by computing representative subsamples of k-mers within both, probed reads and locally constrained regions of the reference genomes. As a result, MetaCache consumes significantly less memory compared to the state-of-the-art read classifiers Kraken and CLARK while achieving highly competitive sensitivity and precision at comparable speed. For example, using NCBI RefSeq draft and completed genomes with a total length of around 140 billion bases as reference, MetaCache's database consumes only 62 GB of memory while both Kraken and CLARK fail to construct their respective databases on a workstation with 512 GB RAM. Our experimental results further show that classification accuracy continuously improves when increasing the amount of utilized reference genome data.

This issue is expected to be especially important for Cyanobacteria because axenic strains are notoriously difficult to obtain and keep in culture. Yet, despite their great scientific interest, no data are currently available concerning the quality of publicly available cyanobacterial genomes. As reliably detecting contaminants is a complex task, we designed a pipeline combining six methods in a consensus strategy to assess the contamination level of 440 genome assemblies of Cyanobacteria. Two methods are based on published reference databases of ribosomal genes (SSU rRNA 16S and ribosomal proteins), one is indirectly based on a reference database of marker genes (CheckM), and three are based on complete genome analysis. Among those genome-wide methods, Kraken and DIAMOND blastx share the same reference database that we derived from Ensembl Bacteria, whereas CONCOCT does not require any reference database, instead relying on differences in DNA tetramer frequencies. Given that all the six methods appear to have their own strengths and limitations, we used the consensus of their rankings to infer that {\textgreater}5\% of cyanobacterial genome assemblies are highly contaminated by foreign DNA (i.e., contaminants were detected by 5 or 6 methods). Our results will help researchers to check the quality of publicly available genomic data before use in their own analyses. Moreover, we argue that journals should make mandatory the submission of raw read data along with genome assemblies in order to facilitate the detection of contaminants in sequence databases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The problem of supervised DNA sequence classification arises in several fields of computational molecular biology. Although this problem has been extensively studied, it is still computationally challenging due to size of the datasets that modern sequencing technologies can produce. RESULTS: We introduce CLARK a novel approach to classify metagenomic reads at the species or genus level with high accuracy and high speed. Extensive experimental results on various metagenomic samples show that the classification accuracy of CLARK is better or comparable to the best state-of-the-art tools and it is significantly faster than any of its competitors. In its fastest single-threaded mode CLARK classifies, with high accuracy, about 32 million metagenomic short reads per minute. CLARK can also classify BAC clones or transcripts to chromosome arms and centromeric regions. CONCLUSIONS: CLARK is a versatile, fast and accurate sequence classification method, especially useful for metagenomics and genomics applications.

	abstract = {A few metazoan lineages are thought to have persisted for millions of years without sexual reproduction. If so, they would offer important clues to the evolutionary paradox of sex itself [1, 2]. Most "ancient asexuals" are subject to ongoing doubt because extant populations continue to invest in males [3-9]. However, males are famously unknown in bdelloid rotifers, a class of microscopic invertebrates comprising hundreds of species [10-12]. Bdelloid genomes have acquired an unusually high proportion of genes from non-metazoans via horizontal transfer [13-17]. This well-substantiated finding has invited speculation [13] that homologous horizontal transfer between bdelloid individuals also may occur, perhaps even "replacing" sex [14]. In 2016, Current Biology published an article claiming to supply evidence for this idea. Debortoli et al. [18] sampled rotifers from natural populations and sequenced one mitochondrial and four nuclear loci. Species assignments were incongruent among loci for several samples, which was interpreted as evidence of "interspecific horizontal genetic transfers." Here, we use sequencing chromatograms supplied by the authors to demonstrate that samples treated as individuals actually contained two or more highly divergent mitochondrial and ribosomal sequences, revealing cross-contamination with DNA from multiple animals of different species. Other chromatograms indicate contamination with DNA from conspecific animals, explaining genetic and genomic evidence for "intraspecific horizontal exchanges" reported in the same study. Given the clear evidence of contamination, the data and findings of Debortoli et al. [18] provide no reliable support for their conclusions that DNA is transferred horizontally between or within bdelloid species.},

Our large-scale scan of complete and draft bacterial and archaeal genomes in the NCBI RefSeq database reveals that 2250 genomes are contaminated by human sequence. The contaminant sequences derive primarily from high-copy human repeat regions, which themselves are not adequately represented in the current human reference genome, GRCh38. The absence of the sequences from the human assembly offers a likely explanation for their presence in bacterial assemblies. In some cases, the contaminating contigs have been erroneously annotated as containing protein-coding sequences, which over time have propagated to create spurious protein "families" across multiple prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. As a result, 3437 spurious protein entries are currently present in the widely used nr and TrEMBL protein databases. We report here an extensive list of contaminant sequences in bacterial genome assemblies and the proteins associated with them. We found that nearly all contaminants occurred in small contigs in draft genomes, which suggests that filtering out small contigs from draft genome assemblies may mitigate the issue of contamination while still keeping nearly all of the genuine genomic sequences.},

	abstract = {Sequence-level searches on large collections of RNA sequencing experiments, such as the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA), would enable one to ask many questions about the expression or variation of a given transcript in a population. Existing approaches, such as the sequence Bloom tree, suffer from fundamental limitations of the Bloom filter, resulting in slow build and query times, less-than-optimal space usage, and potentially large numbers of false-positives. This paper introduces Mantis, a space-efficient system that uses new data structures to index thousands of raw-read experiments and facilitates large-scale sequence searches. In our evaluation, index construction with Mantis is 6× faster and yields a 20\% smaller index than the state-of-the-art split sequence Bloom tree (SSBT). For queries, Mantis is 6–108× faster than SSBT and has no false-positives or -negatives. For example, Mantis was able to search for all 200,400 known human transcripts in an index of 2,652 RNA sequencing experiments in 82 min; SSBT took close to 4 days. Mantis is a system to index and search through large collections of raw sequencing data. The query sequence can be a known or newly assembled gene or any valid nucleotide sequence. Mantis is faster and smaller than existing sequence-search tools and is exact in the sense that it does not report false-positives. To construct the index, Mantis indexes the k-mers (substrings of size k) in the reads of an experiment and then groups k-mers across experiments that exhibit the same patterns of occurrence.},

	abstract = {T-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) is a widely used data visualisation technique. It differs from its predecessor SNE by the low-dimensional similarity kernel: the Gaussian kernel was replaced by the heavy-tailed Cauchy kernel, solving the "crowding problem" of SNE. Here, we develop an efficient implementation of t-SNE for a \$t\$-distribution kernel with an arbitrary degree of freedom \${\textbackslash}backslashnu\{{\textbackslash}\$\}, with \${\textbackslash}backslashnu{\textbackslash}backslashto{\textbackslash}backslashinfty\{{\textbackslash}\$\} corresponding to SNE and \${\textbackslash}backslashnu=1\$ corresponding to the standard t-SNE. Using theoretical analysis and toy examples, we show that \${\textbackslash}backslashnu\{{\textbackslash}textless\}1\$ can further reduce the crowding problem and reveal finer cluster structure that is invisible in standard t-SNE. We further demonstrate the striking effect of heavier-tailed kernels on large real-life data sets such as MNIST, single-cell RNA-sequencing data, and the HathiTrust library. We use domain knowledge to confirm that the revealed clusters are meaningful. Overall, we argue that modifying the tail heaviness of the t-SNE kernel can yield additional insight into the cluster structure of the data.},

This symbiont is a member of the recently described bacterial order Orbales, which has been collected from the guts of diverse insect species; however, "Ca. Schmidhempelia" has been identified exclusively with bumble bees. Metabolic reconstruction reveals that "Ca. Schmidhempelia" lacks many genes for a functioning NADH dehydrogenase I, all genes for the high-oxygen cytochrome o, and most genes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. "Ca. Schmidhempelia" has retained NADH dehydrogenase II, the low-oxygen specific cytochrome bd, anaerobic nitrate respiration, mixed-acid fermentation pathways, and citrate fermentation, which may be important for survival in low-oxygen or anaerobic environments found in the bee hindgut. Additionally, a type 6 secretion system, a Flp pilus, and many antibiotic/multidrug transporters suggest complex interactions with its host and other gut commensals or pathogens. This genome has signatures of reduction (2.0 megabase pairs) and rearrangement, as previously observed for genomes of host-associated bacteria. A survey of wild and laboratory B. impatiens revealed that "Ca. Schmidhempelia" is present in 90\% of individuals and, therefore, may provide benefits to its host.},

Metagenomic sequencing provides a means to access the DNA sequence of uncultured microbes. By combining DNA sequencing of microbial communities with evolutionary modeling and phylogenetic analysis we might obtain new insights into microbiology and also provide a basis for practical tools such as forensic pathogen detection. In this work we present an approach to leverage phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic sequence data to conduct several types of analysis. First, we present a method to conduct phylogeny-driven Bayesian hypothesis tests for the presence of an organism in a sample. Second, we present a means to compare community structure across a collection of many samples and develop direct associations between the abundance of certain organisms and sample metadata. Third, we apply new tools to analyze the phylogenetic diversity of microbial communities and again demonstrate how this can be associated to sample metadata. These analyses are implemented in an open source software pipeline called PhyloSift. As a pipeline, PhyloSift incorporates several other programs including LAST, HMMER, and pplacer to automate phylogenetic analysis of protein coding and RNA sequences in metagenomic datasets generated by modern sequencing platforms (e.g., Illumina, 454).},

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/bty1071},
	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Metagenomics is the study of genetic materials directly sampled from natural habitats. It has the potential to reveal previously hidden diversity of microscopic life largely due to the existence of highly parallel and low-cost next-generation sequencing technology. Conventional approaches align metagenomic reads onto known reference genomes to identify microbes in the sample. Since such a collection of reference genomes is very large, the approach often needs high-end computing machines with large memory which is not often available to researchers. Alternative approaches follow an alignment-free methodology where the presence of a microbe is predicted using the information about the unique k-mers present in the microbial genomes. However, such approaches suffer from high false positives due to trading off the value of k with the computational resources. In this article, we propose a highly efficient metagenomic sequence classification (MSC) algorithm that is a hybrid of both approaches. Instead of aligning reads to the full genomes, MSC aligns reads onto a set of carefully chosen, shorter and highly discriminating model sequences built from the unique k-mers of each of the reference sequences. RESULTS: Microbiome researchers are generally interested in two objectives of a taxonomic classifier: (i) to detect prevalence, i.e. the taxa present in a sample, and (ii) to estimate their relative abundances. MSC is primarily designed to detect prevalence and experimental results show that MSC is indeed a more effective and efficient algorithm compared to the other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy, memory and runtime. Moreover, MSC outputs an approximate estimate of the abundances. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The implementations are freely available for non-commercial purposes.

This improves on the best previously known cardinality estimator, LOGLOG, whose accuracy can be matched by consuming only 64\% of the original memory. For instance, the new algorithm makes it possible to estimate cardinalities well beyond 10 9 with a typical accuracy of 2\% while using a memory of only 1.5 kilobytes.

As more than 30\% of them could not previously be quantified at this taxonomic resolution, relative abundance estimates based on mOTUs are more accurate compared to other methods.

However, these sequences may also indicate either symbiont genes or lateral gene transfer (LGT) to host genomes. These bacterial sequences can provide clues about eukaryote-microbe interactions. Here, we used the genome of the primitive animal Trichoplax adhaerens (Metazoa: Placozoa), which is known to harbor an uncharacterized Gram-negative endosymbiont, to search for the presence of bacterial DNA sequences. Bioinformatic and phylogenomic analyses of extracted data from the genome assembly (181 bacterial coding sequences [CDS]) and trace read archive (16S rDNA) revealed a dominant proteobacterial profile strongly skewed to Rickettsiales (Alphaproteobacteria) genomes. By way of phylogenetic analysis of 16S rDNA and 113 proteins conserved across proteobacterial genomes, as well as identification of 27 rickettsial signature genes, we propose a Rickettsiales endosymbiont of T. adhaerens (RETA). The majority (93\%) of the identified bacterial CDS belongs to small scaffolds containing prokaryotic-like genes; however, 12 CDS were identified on large scaffolds comprised of eukaryotic-like genes, suggesting that T. adhaerens might have recently acquired bacterial genes. These putative LGTs may coincide with the placozoan's aquatic niche and symbiosis with RETA. This work underscores the rich, and relatively untapped, resource of eukaryotic genome projects for harboring data pertinent to host-microbial interactions. The nature of unknown (or poorly characterized) bacterial species may only emerge via analysis of host genome sequencing projects, particularly if these species are resistant to cell culturing, as are many obligate intracellular microbes.

Here, we introduce a framework for similarity search based on characterizing a dataset's entropy and fractal dimension. We prove that searching scales in time with metric entropy (number of covering hyperspheres), if the fractal dimension of the dataset is low, and scales in space with the sum of metric entropy and information-theoretic entropy (randomness of the data). Using these ideas, we present accelerated versions of standard tools, with no loss in specificity and little loss in sensitivity, for use in three domains - high-throughput drug screening (Ammolite, 150× speedup), metagenomics (MICA, 3.5× speedup of DIAMOND [3,700× BLASTX]), and protein structure search (esFragBag, 10× speedup of FragBag). Our framework can be used to achieve "'compressive omics," and the general theory can be readily applied to data science problems outside of biology (source code: http://gems.csail.mit.edu).},

Calculating ANI usually involves the fragmentation of genome sequences, followed by nucleotide sequence search, alignment, and identity calculation. The original algorithm to calculate ANI used the BLAST program as its search engine. An improved ANI algorithm, called OrthoANI, was developed to accommodate the concept of orthology. Here, we compared four algorithms to compute ANI, namely ANIb (ANI algorithm using BLAST), ANIm (ANI using MUMmer), OrthoANIb (OrthoANI using BLAST) and OrthoANIu (OrthoANI using USEARCH) using {\textgreater}100,000 pairs of genomes with various genome sizes. By comparing values to the ANIb that is considered a standard, OrthoANIb and OrthoANIu exhibited good correlation in the whole range of ANI values. ANIm showed poor correlation for ANI of {\textless}90\%. ANIm and OrthoANIu runs faster than ANIb by an order of magnitude. When genomes that are larger than 7 Mbp were analysed, the run-times of ANIm and OrthoANIu were shorter than that of ANIb by 53- and 22-fold, respectively. In conclusion, ANI calculation can be greatly sped up by the OrthoANIu method without losing accuracy. A web-service that can be used to calculate OrthoANIu between a pair of genome sequences is available at http://www.ezbiocloud.net/tools/ani .

However ambiguity among the sequences of many strains makes it difficult to assign reads at the lowest level of taxonomy, and reads are typically assigned to taxonomic levels where they are unambiguous. We explore connections between metagenomic read assignment and the quantification of transcripts from RNA-Seq data in order to develop novel methods for rapid and accurate quantification of metagenomic strains. Results: We find that the recent idea of pseudoalignment introduced in the RNA-Seq context is highly applicable in the metagenomics setting. When coupled with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, reads can be assigned far more accurately and quickly than is currently possible with state of the art software, making it possible and practical for the first time to analyze abundances of individual genomes in metagenomics projects.

We used efficient microbiome analysis software to scan the draft assembly of domestic cow, Bos taurus, and identify 173 small contigs that appeared to derive from microbial contaminants. In the course of verifying these findings, we discovered that one genome, Neisseria gonorrhoeae TCDC-NG08107, although putatively a complete genome, contained multiple sequences that actually derived from the cow and sheep genomes.

However, even though they are able to deliver reliable results, other algorithms seem to work better in some cases. To improve k-mer-based DNA sequence analysis and comparison, we successfully checked whether adding positional resolution is beneficial for finding and/or comparing interesting organizational structures. A simple but efficient algorithm for extracting and saving local k-mer spectra (frequency distribution of k-mers) was developed and used. The results were analyzed by including positional information based on visualizations as genomic maps and by applying basic vector correlation methods. This analysis was concentrated on small word lengths (1 ≤ k ≤ 4) on relatively small viral genomes of Papillomaviridae and Herpesviridae, while also checking its usability for larger sequences, namely human chromosome 2 and the homologous chromosomes (2A, 2B) of a chimpanzee. Using this alignment-free analysis, several regions with specific characteristics in Papillomaviridae and Herpesviridae formerly identified by independent, mostly alignment-based methods, were confirmed. Correlations between the k-mer content and several genes in these genomes have been found, showing similarities between classified and unclassified viruses, which may be potentially useful for further taxonomic research. Furthermore, unknown k-mer correlations in the genomes of Human Herpesviruses (HHVs), which are probably of major biological function, are found and described. Using the chromosomes of a chimpanzee and human that are currently known, identities between the species on every analyzed chromosome were reproduced. This demonstrates the feasibility of our approach for large data sets of complex genomes. Based on these results, we suggest k-mer analysis with positional resolution as a method for closing a gap between the effectiveness of alignment-based methods (like NCBI BLAST) and the high pace of standard k-mer analysis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cost of Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) has decreased tremendously in recent years due to advances in next-generation sequencing technologies. Nevertheless, the cost of carrying out large-scale cohort studies using WGS is still daunting. Past simulation studies with coverage at {\textasciitilde}2x have shown promise for using low coverage WGS in studies focused on variant discovery, association study replications, and population genomics characterization. However, the performance of low coverage WGS in populations with a complex history and no reference panel remains to be determined. RESULTS: South Indian populations are known to have a complex population structure and are an example of a major population group that lacks adequate reference panels. To test the performance of extremely low-coverage WGS (EXL-WGS) in populations with a complex history and to provide a reference resource for South Indian populations, we performed EXL-WGS on 185 South Indian individuals from eight populations to {\textasciitilde}1.6x coverage. Using two variant discovery pipelines, SNPTools and GATK, we generated a consensus call set that has {\textasciitilde}90\% sensitivity for identifying common variants (minor allele frequency ≥ 10\%). Imputation further improves the sensitivity of our call set. In addition, we obtained high-coverage for the whole mitochondrial genome to infer the maternal lineage evolutionary history of the Indian samples. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we demonstrate that EXL-WGS with imputation can be a valuable study design for variant discovery with a dramatically lower cost than standard WGS, even in populations with a complex history and without available reference data. In addition, the South Indian EXL-WGS data generated in this study will provide a valuable resource for future Indian genomic studies.},

Identification of the microorganisms in a sample provides information about the genetic profile, population structure, and role of microorganisms within an environment. Until recently, most metagenomics studies focused on high-level characterization at the level of phyla, or alternatively sequenced the 16S ribosomal RNA gene that is present in bacterial species. As the cost of sequencing has fallen, though, metagenomics experiments have increasingly used unbiased shotgun sequencing to capture all the organisms in a sample. This approach requires a method for estimating abundance directly from the raw read data. Here we describe a fast, accurate new method that computes the abundance at the species level using the reads collected in a metagenomics experiment. Bracken (Bayesian Reestimation of Abundance after Classification with KrakEN) uses the taxonomic assignments made by Kraken, a very fast read-level classifier, along with information about the genomes themselves to estimate abundance at the species level, the genus level, or above. We demonstrate that Bracken can produce accurate species- and genus-level abundance estimates even when a sample contains multiple near-identical species.},

	abstract = {Inference of gene sequences in ancestral species has been widely used to test hypotheses concerning the process of molecular sequence evolution. However, the approach may produce spurious results, mainly because using the single best reconstruction while ignoring the suboptimal ones creates systematic biases. Here we implement methods to correct for such biases and use computer simulation to evaluate their performance when the substitution process is nonstationary. The methods we evaluated include parsimony and likelihood using the single best reconstruction (SBR), averaging over reconstructions weighted by the posterior probabilities (AWP), and a new method called expected Markov counting (EMC) that produces maximum-likelihood estimates of substitution counts for any branch under a nonstationary Markov model. We simulated base composition evolution on a phylogeny for six species, with different selective pressures on G+C content among lineages, and compared the counts of nucleotide substitutions recorded during simulation with the inference by different methods. We found that large systematic biases resulted from (i) the use of parsimony or likelihood with SBR, (ii) the use of a stationary model when the substitution process is nonstationary, and (iii) the use of the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY) model, which is too simple to adequately describe the substitution process. The nonstationary general time reversible (GTR) model, used with AWP or EMC, accurately recovered the substitution counts, even in cases of complex parameter fluctuations. We discuss model complexity and the compromise between bias and variance and suggest that the new methods may be useful for studying complex patterns of nucleotide substitution in large genomic data sets.},

	doi = {10.1101/451690},
	abstract = {In single cell analysis, visualization of high-dimensional data is essential for information extraction and interpretation. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a dimensionality reduction algorithm that facilitates visualization of complex high-dimensional cytometry data as a two-dimensional distribution or 'map'. t-SNE maps can be interrogated by either expert-driven or automated techniques to categorize single cell data into relevant biological populations and discern biologically relevant differences between individual samples. The use of t-SNE for high parameter mass and fluorescent cytometry datasets enables a comprehensive and unbiased view of results as compared to traditional biaxial gating. However, successful t-SNE visualization depends on heuristic titration of multiple parameters, as non-optimal embeddings can carry artifacts that make the map difficult or impossible to interpret. Moreover, standard t-SNE implementations fail to produce clear visualizations of datasets when millions of datapoints are projected on the map, often making this method unusable for larger biological datasets. To overcome current t-SNE limitations, we formulated opt-SNE, an array of automated tools for optimal parameter selection in t-SNE visualization. For optimal and fastest data embedding, opt-SNE utilizes Kullback-Liebler (KL) divergence evaluation in real time by tailoring the early exaggeration stage of t-SNE gradient computation in a dataset-specific manner. Here, we demonstrate that precise timing of early exaggeration and scaling the gradient descent learning rate step to the size of the dataset together dramatically improve computation time and enable high quality visualization of both large cytometry and transcriptomics datasets. Also, our results explain why existing software solutions with hard-coded t-SNE parameters produce poorly resolved and potentially misleading maps of fluorescent and mass cytometry data. In sum, our novel approach to t-SNE enables the required fine-tuning of the algorithm to ensure optimal resolution of t-SNE maps and more precise data interpretation.},

A dominant method of such string matching is the 'seed-and-extend' approach, in which occurrences of short subsequences called 'seeds' are used to search for potentially longer matches in a large database of sequences. Each such potential match is then checked to see if it extends beyond the seed. To be effective, the seed-and-extend approach needs to catalogue seeds from virtually every substring in the database of search strings. Projects such as mammalian genome assemblies and large-scale protein matching, however, have such large sequence databases that the resulting list of seeds cannot be stored in RAM on a single computer. This significantly slows the matching process. RESULTS: We present a simple and elegant method in which only a small fraction of seeds, called 'minimizers', needs to be stored. Using minimizers can speed up string-matching computations by a large factor while missing only a small fraction of the matches found using all seeds.},

Although improvements in alignment accuracy can be obtained by providing better guide trees, in general there is little effect on the "accuracy" (measured using the SP-score) of the alignment by improving the guide tree. However, RAxML-based phylogenetic analyses of alignments based upon better guide trees tend to be much more accurate. This impact is particularly significant for ProbCons, one of the best MSA methods currently available, and our method, FTA. Finally, for very good guide trees, phylogenies based upon FTA alignments are more accurate than phylogenies based upon ProbCons alignments, suggesting that further improvements in phylogenetic accuracy may be obtained through algorithms of this type.},

As data sets grow, however, the fraction of the tree space examined by the NJ algorithm becomes minuscule. Here, we report the results of our computer simulation for examining the accuracy of NJ trees for inferring very large phylogenies. First we present a likelihood method for the simultaneous estimation of all pairwise distances by using biologically realistic models of nucleotide substitution. Use of this method corrects up to 60\% of NJ tree errors. Our simulation results show that the accuracy of NJ trees decline only by ≈5\% when the number of sequences used increases from 32 to 4,096 (128 times) even in the presence of extensive variation in the evolutionary rate among lineages or significant biases in the nucleotide composition and transition/transversion ratio. Our results encourage the use of complex models of nucleotide substitution for estimating evolutionary distances and hint at bright prospects for the application of the NJ and related methods in inferring large phylogenies.},

Sequence segments between those anchor points are then aligned with slower, more sensitive methods. Finding suitable anchor points is therefore crucial for genome sequence comparison; speed and sensitivity of genome alignment depend on the underlying anchoring methods. Results In this article, we use filtered spaced word matches to generate anchor points for genome alignment. For a given binary pattern representing match and don't-care positions, we first search for spaced-word matches, i.e. ungapped local pairwise alignments with matching nucleotides at the match positions of the pattern and possible mismatches at the don't-care positions. Those spaced-word matches that have similarity scores above some threshold value are then extended using a standard X-drop algorithm; the resulting local alignments are used as anchor points. To evaluate this approach, we used the popular multiple-genome-alignment pipeline Mugsy and replaced the exact word matches that Mugsy uses as anchor points with our spaced-word-based anchor points. For closely related genome sequences, the two anchoring procedures lead to multiple alignments of similar quality. For distantly related genomes, however, alignments calculated with our filtered-spaced-word matches are superior to alignments produced with the original Mugsy program where exact word matches are used to find anchor points.

In particular, alignment-free methods are much faster than pairwise or multiple alignments. They are, however, less accurate than methods based on sequence alignment. Most alignment-free approaches work by comparing the word composition of sequences. A well-known problem with these methods is that neighbouring word matches are far from independent. Results: To reduce the statistical dependency between adjacent word matches, we propose to use 'spaced words', defined by patterns of 'match' and 'don't care' positions, for alignment-free sequence comparison. We describe a fast implementation of this approach using recursive hashing and bit operations, and we show that further improvements can be achieved by using multiple patterns instead of single patterns. To evaluate our approach, we use spaced-word frequencies as a basis for fast phylogeny reconstruction. Using real-world and simulated sequence data, we demonstrate that our multiple-pattern approach produces better phylogenies than approaches relying on contiguous words. © 2014 The Author 2014.},

One approach is to use an alignment-free method in which feature (or /-mer) frequency profiles (FFP) of whole genomes are used for comparison-a variation of a text or book comparison method, using word frequency profiles. In this approach it is critical to identify the optimal resolution range of /-mers for the given set of genomes compared. The optimum FFP method is applicable for comparing whole genomes or large genomic regions even when there are no common genes with high homology. We outline the method in 3 stages: (i) We first show how the optimal resolution range can be determined with English books which have been transformed into long character strings by removing all punctuation and spaces, (ii) Next, we test the robustness of the optimized FFP method at the nucleotide level, using a mutation model with a wide range of base substitutions and rearrangements. (iii) Finally, to illustrate the utility of the method, phytogenies are reconstructed from concatenated mammalian intronic genomes; the FFP derived intronic genome to-pologies for each / within the optimal range are all very similar. The topology agrees with the established mammalian phytogeny revealing that intron regions contain a similar level of phylogenic signal as do coding regions. © 2009 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Existing alignment-free programs, however, are less accurate than alignment-based methods. Results We propose Filtered Spaced Word Matches (FSWM) , a fast alignment-free approach to estimate phylogenetic distances between large genomic sequences. For a pre-defined binary pattern of match and don't-care positions, FSWM rapidly identifies spaced word-matches between input sequences, i.e. gap-free local alignments with matching nucleotides at the match positions and with mismatches allowed at the don't-care positions. We then estimate the number of nucleotide substitutions per site by considering the nucleotides aligned at the don't-care positions of the identified spaced-word matches. To reduce the noise from spurious random matches, we use a filtering procedure where we discard all spaced-word matches for which the overall similarity between the aligned segments is below a threshold. We show that our approach can accurately estimate substitution frequencies even for distantly related sequences that cannot be analyzed with existing alignment-free methods; phylogenetic trees constructed with FSWM distances are of high quality.

	abstract = {Alignment is a crucial issue in molecular phylogenetics because different alignment methods can potentially yield very different topologies for individual genes. But it is unclear if the choice of alignment methods remains important in phylogenomic analyses, which incorporate data from dozens, hundreds, or thousands of genes. For example, problematic biases in alignment might be multiplied across many loci, whereas alignment errors in individual genes might become irrelevant. The issue of alignment trimming (i.e. removing poorly aligned regions or missing data from individual genes) is also poorly explored. Here, we test the impact of 12 different combinations of alignment and trimming methods on phylogenomic analyses. We compare these methods using published phylogenomic data from ultraconserved elements (UCEs) from squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes), birds, and tetrapods. We compare the properties of alignments generated by different alignment and trimming methods (e.g., length, informative sites, missing data). We also test whether these datasets can recover well-established clades when analyzed with concatenated (RAxML) and species-tree methods (ASTRAL-III), using the full data (∼5,000 loci) and subsampled datasets (10\% and 1\% of loci). We show that different alignment and trimming methods can significantly impact various aspects of phylogenomic datasets (e.g. length, informative sites). However, these different methods generally had little impact on the recovery and support values for well-established clades, even across very different numbers of loci. Nevertheless, our results suggest several “best practices” for alignment and trimming. Intriguingly, the choice of phylogenetic methods impacted the results most strongly, with concatenated analyses recovering significantly more well-established clades (with stronger support) than the species-tree analyses.},

	abstract = {Species are commonly thought to be evolutionarily independent in a way that populations within a species are not. In recent years, studies that seek to identify evolutionarily independent lineages (i.e., to delimit species) using genetic data have typically adopted multispecies coalescent approaches that assume that evolutionary independence is formed by the differential sorting of ancestral alleles due to genetic drift. However, gene flow appears to be common among populations and nascent species, and while this process may inhibit lineage divergence (and thus independence), it is usually not explicitly considered when delimiting species. In this paper, we apply PHRAPL, a recently described method for phylogeographic model selection, to species delimitation. We describe an approach to delimiting species using PHRAPL that attempts to account for both genetic drift and gene flow, and we compare the method’s performance to that of a popular delimitation approach (BPP) using both simulated and empirical datasets. PHRAPL generally infers the correct demographic-delimitation model when the generating model includes gene flow between taxa, given a sufficient amount of data. When the generating model includes only isolation in the recent past, PHRAPL will in some cases fail to differentiate between gene flow and divergence, leading to model misspecification. Nevertheless, the explicit consideration of gene flow by PHRAPL is an important complement to existing delimitation approaches, particularly in systems where gene flow is likely important.},

Rates of evolution have accelerated in pathogenic lineages, culminating in highly virulent organisms whose genomic contents are altered frequently by increased rates of homologous recombination; thus, the evolution of virulence is linked to bacterial sex.

This paper presents the first systematic study of the most commonly used alignment programs using BAliBASE benchmark alignments as test cases. Even below the 'twilight zone' at 10-20\% residue identity, the best programs were capable of correctly aligning on average 47\% of the residues. We show that iterative algorithms often offer improved alignment accuracy though at the expense of computation time. A notable exception was the effect of introducing a single divergent sequence into a set of closely related sequences, causing the iteration to diverge away from the best alignment. Global alignment programs generally performed better than local methods, except in the presence of large N/C-terminal extensions and internal insertions. In these cases, a local algorithm was more successful in identifying the most conserved motifs. This study enables us to propose appropriate alignment strategies, depending on the nature of a particular set of sequences. The employment of more than one program based on different alignment techniques should significantly improve the quality of automatic protein sequence alignment methods. The results also indicate guidelines for improvement of alignment algorithms.},

	abstract = {Metabolism mediates the flow of matter and energy through the biosphere. We examined how metabolic evolution shapes ecosystems by reconstructing it in the globally abundant oceanic phytoplankter Prochlorococcus. To understand what drove observed evolutionary patterns, we interpreted them in the context of its population dynamics, growth rate, and light adaptation, and the size and macromolecular and elemental composition of cells. This multilevel view suggests that, over the course of evolution, there was a steady increase in Prochlorococcus’ metabolic rate and excretion of organic carbon. We derived a mathematical framework that suggests these adaptations lower the minimal subsistence nutrient concentration of cells, which results in a drawdown of nutrients in oceanic surface waters. This, in turn, increases total ecosystem biomass and promotes the coevolution of all cells in the ecosystem. Additional reconstructions suggest that Prochlorococcus and the dominant cooccurring heterotrophic bacterium SAR11 form a coevolved mutualism that maximizes their collective metabolic rate by recycling organic carbon through complementary excretion and uptake pathways. Moreover, the metabolic codependencies of Prochlorococcus and SAR11 are highly similar to those of chloroplasts and mitochondria within plant cells. These observations lead us to propose a general theory relating metabolic evolution to the self-amplification and self-organization of the biosphere. We discuss the implications of this framework for the evolution of Earth’s biogeochemical cycles and the rise of atmospheric oxygen.},

Virus entry into cells depends on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S). Although there is no vaccine, it is likely that antibodies will be essential for protection. However, little is known about the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-21–5. Here we report on 149 COVID-19 convalescent individuals. Plasmas collected an average of 39 days after the onset of symptoms had variable half-maximal pseudovirus neutralizing titres: less than 1:50 in 33\% and below 1:1,000 in 79\%, while only 1\% showed titres above 1:5,000. Antibody sequencing revealed expanded clones of RBD-specific memory B cells expressing closely related antibodies in different individuals. Despite low plasma titres, antibodies to three distinct epitopes on RBD neutralized at half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values) as low as single digit nanograms per millitre. Thus, most convalescent plasmas obtained from individuals who recover from COVID-19 do not contain high levels of neutralizing activity. Nevertheless, rare but recurring RBD-specific antibodies with potent antiviral activity were found in all individuals tested, suggesting that a vaccine designed to elicit such antibodies could be broadly effective.},

We used molecular dynamics simulations and models of affinity maturation to study specific bnAbs against HIV. Our results suggest that there are different classes of evolutionary lineages for the bnAbs. If germline B cells that initiate affinity maturation have high affinity for the conserved residues of the targeted epitope, framework mutations increase antibody rigidity as affinity maturation progresses to evolve bnAbs. If the germline B cells exhibit weak/moderate affinity for conserved residues, an initial increase in flexibility via framework mutations may be required for the evolution of bnAbs. Subsequent mutations that increase rigidity result in highly potent bnAbs. Implications of our results for immunogen design are discussed.},

Investigations of antibody evolution define modes whereby particular antibody responses are able to form, and such studies provide insight important for instance for development of efficient vaccines. Antibody evolution is also used in vitro for the design of antibodies with improved properties. To better understand the basic concepts of antibody evolution, we analyzed the mutational paths, both in terms of amino acid substitution and insertions and deletions, taken by antibodies of the IgG isotype. The analysis focused on the evolution of the heavy chain variable domain of sets of antibodies, each with an origin in 1 of 11 different germline genes representing six human heavy chain germline gene subgroups. Investigated genes were isolated from cells of human bone marrow, a major site of antibody production, and characterized by next-generation sequencing and an in-house bioinformatics pipeline. Apart from substitutions within the complementarity determining regions, multiple framework residues including those in protein cores were targets of extensive diversification. Diversity, both in terms of substitutions, and insertions and deletions, in antibodies is focused to different positions in the sequence in a germline gene-unique manner. Altogether, our findings create a framework for understanding patterns of evolution of antibodies from defined germline genes.},

The toolkit supports multiplexed primer pools, single- or paired-end reads and emerging technologies that use single-molecule identifiers. pRESTO has been tested on data generated from Roche and Illumina platforms. It has a built-in capacity to parallelize the work between available processors and is able to efficiently process millions of sequences generated by typical high-throughput projects. © The Author 2014.},

We found that gut IgM+ plasma cells (PCs) were more abundant in humans than mice and clonally related to a large repertoire of memory IgM+ B cells disseminated throughout the intestine but rare in systemic lymphoid organs. In addition to sharing a gut-specific gene signature with memory IgA+ B cells, memory IgM+ B cells were related to some IgA+ clonotypes and switched to IgA in response to T cell-independent or T cell-dependent signals. These signals induced abundant IgM which, together with SIgM from clonally affiliated PCs, recognized mucus-embedded commensals. Bacteria recognized by human SIgM were dually coated by SIgA and showed increased richness and diversity compared to IgA-only-coated or uncoated bacteria. Thus, SIgM may emerge from pre-existing memory rather than newly activated naive IgM+ B cells and could help SIgA to anchor highly diverse commensal communities to mucus. Magri et al. found that the human gut includes a large memory IgM+ B cell repertoire clonally related to plasma cells mounting SIgM responses against mucus-embedded commensals co-targeted by SIgA.

We used 454 sequencing and designed a novel phylogenetic method to model lineage evolution of the bnAbs PGT121-134 and found a positive correlation between the level of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and the development of neutralization breadth and potency. Strikingly, putative intermediates were characterized that show approximately half the mutation level of PGT121-134 but were still capable of neutralizing roughly 40-80\% of PGT121-134 sensitive viruses in a 74-virus panel at median titers between 15- and 3-fold higher than PGT121-134. Such antibodies with lower levels of SHM may be more amenable to elicitation through vaccination while still providing noteworthy coverage. Binding characterization indicated a preference of inferred intermediates for native Env binding over monomeric gp120, suggesting that the PGT121-134 lineage may have been selected for binding to native Env at some point during maturation. Analysis of glycan-dependent neutralization for inferred intermediates identified additional adjacent glycans that comprise the epitope and suggests changes in glycan dependency or recognition over the course of affinity maturation for this lineage. Finally, patterns of neutralization of inferred bnAb intermediates suggest hypotheses as to how SHM may lead to potent and broad HIV neutralization and provide important clues for immunogen design. © 2013 Sok et al.},

We measured the dynamics and genetic diversity of B cell responses in five adults longitudinally before and after influenza vaccination using high-throughput antibody repertoire sequencing. We identified vaccine-responsive B cell lineages that carry signatures of selective sweeps driven by positive selection, and discovered that they often display evidence for selective sweeps favoring multiple subclones. We also found persistent B cell lineages that exhibit stable population dynamics and carry signatures of neutral drift. By exploiting the relationship between B cell fitness and antibody binding affinity, we demonstrate the potential for using phylogenetic approaches to identify antibodies with high binding affinity. This quantitative characterization reveals that antibody repertoires are shaped by an unexpectedly broad spectrum of evolutionary processes and shows how signatures of evolutionary history can be harnessed for antibody discovery and engineering.},

	abstract = {The adaptive immune system recognizes antigens via an immense array of antigen-binding antibodies and T-cell receptors, the immune repertoire. The interrogation of immune repertoires is of high relevance for understanding the adaptive immune response in disease and infection (e.g., autoimmunity, cancer, HIV). Adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) has driven the quantitative and molecular-level profiling of immune repertoires, thereby revealing the high-dimensional complexity of the immune receptor sequence landscape. Several methods for the computational and statistical analysis of large-scale AIRR-seq data have been developed to resolve immune repertoire complexity and to understand the dynamics of adaptive immunity. Here, we review the current research on (i) diversity, (ii) clustering and network, (iii) phylogenetic, and (iv) machine learning methods applied to dissect, quantify, and compare the architecture, evolution, and specificity of immune repertoires. We summarize outstanding questions in computational immunology and propose future directions for systems immunology toward coupling AIRR-seq with the computational discovery of immunotherapeutics, vaccines, and immunodiagnostics.},

In the present work, we describe a set of tools for the analysis of antibody repertoires and their application to elucidating the dynamics of the response to viral vaccination in human volunteers. By analyzing data from38 separate blood samples across 2 y, we found that the use of the germ-line library of V and J segments is conserved between individuals over time. Surprisingly, there appeared to be no correlation between the use level of a particular VJ combination and degree of expansion. We found the antibody RNA repertoire in each volunteer to be highly dynamic, with each individual displaying qualitatively different response dynamics. By using combinatorial phage display, we screened selected VH genes paired with their corresponding VL library for affinity against the vaccine antigens. Altogether, this work presents an additional set of tools for profiling the human antibody repertoire and demonstrates characterization of the fast repertoire dynamics through time in multiple individuals responding to an immune challenge.},

	abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by autoimmunemediated demyelination and neurodegeneration. The CNS of patients withMSharbors expanded clones of antigen-experienced B cells that reside in distinct compartments including the meninges, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and parenchyma. It is not understood whether this immune infiltrate initiates its development in the CNS or in peripheral tissues. B cells in the CSF can exchange with those in peripheral blood, implying that CNS B cells may have access to lymphoid tissue that may be the specific compartment(s) in which CNS-resident B cells encounter antigen and experience affinitymaturation. Paired tissues were used to determine whether the B cells that populate the CNS mature in the draining cervical lymph nodes (CLNs). High-throughput sequencing of the antibody repertoire demonstrated that clonally expanded B cells were present in both compartments. Founding members of clones were more often found in the draining CLNs. More mature clonal members derived from these founders were observed in the draining CLNs and also in the CNS, including lesions. These data provide new evidence that B cells traffic freely across the tissue barrier, with the majority of B cell maturation occurring outside of the CNS in the secondary lymphoid tissue. Our study may aid in further defining the mechanisms of immunomodulatory therapies that either deplete circulating B cells or affect the intrathecal B cell compartment by inhibiting lymphocyte transmigration into the CNS.},

No vaccine is available, and immunity against the virus is not well-understood. Following the acute stage, HCV usually causes chronic infections. However, {\textasciitilde}30\% of infected individuals spontaneously clear the virus. Therefore, using HCV as a model for comparing immune responses between spontaneous clearer (SC) and chronically infected (CI) individuals may empower the identification of mechanisms governing viral infection outcomes. Here, we provide the first in-depth analysis of adaptive immune receptor repertoires in individuals with current or past HCV infection. We demonstrate that SC individuals, in contrast to CI patients, develop clusters of antibodies with distinct properties. These antibodies' characteristics were used in a machine learning framework to accurately predict infection outcome. Using combinatorial antibody phage display library technology, we identified HCV-specific antibody sequences. By integrating these data with the repertoire analysis, we constructed two antibodies characterized by high neutralization breadth, which are associated with clearance. This study provides insight into the nature of effective immune response against HCV and demonstrates an innovative approach for constructing antibodies correlating with successful infection clearance. It may have clinical implications for prognosis of the future status of infection, and the design of effective immunotherapies and a vaccine for HCV.},

	abstract = {Background: A diverse B-cell repertoire is essential for recognition and response to infectious and vaccine antigens. High-throughput sequencing of B-cell receptor (BCR) genes can now be used to study the B-cell repertoire at great depth and may shed more light on B-cell responses than conventional immunological methods. Here, we use high-throughput BCR sequencing to provide novel insight into B-cell dynamics following a primary course of hepatitis B vaccination. Methods: Nine vaccine-naïve participants were administered three doses of hepatitis B vaccine (months 0, 1, and 2 or 7). High-throughput Illumina sequencing of the total BCR repertoire was combined with targeted sequencing of sorted vaccine antigen-enriched B cells to analyze the longitudinal response of both the total and vaccine-specific repertoire after each vaccine. ELISpot was used to determine vaccine-specific cell numbers following each vaccine. Results: Deconvoluting the vaccine-specific from total BCR repertoire showed that vaccine-specific sequence clusters comprised {\textless}0.1 \% of total sequence clusters, and had certain stereotypic features. The vaccine-specific BCR sequence clusters were expanded after each of the three vaccine doses, despite no vaccine-specific B cells being detected by ELISpot after the first vaccine dose. These vaccine-specific BCR clusters detected after the first vaccine dose had distinct properties compared to those detected after subsequent doses; they were more mutated, present at low frequency even prior to vaccination, and appeared to be derived from more mature B cells. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the high-sensitivity of our vaccine-specific BCR analysis approach and suggest an alternative view of the B-cell response to novel antigens. In the response to the first vaccine dose, many vaccine-specific BCR clusters appeared to largely derive from previously activated cross-reactive B cells that have low affinity for the vaccine antigen, and subsequent doses were required to yield higher affinity B cells.},

	abstract = {Objective: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by the presence of anti–citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs); nevertheless, the origin, specificity, and functional properties of ACPAs remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to characterize the evolution of ACPAs by sequencing the plasmablast antibody repertoire at serial time points in patients with established RA. Methods: Blood samples were obtained at up to 4 serial time points from 8 individuals with established RA who were positive for ACPAs by the anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide test. CD19+CD3−IgD−CD14−CD20−CD27+CD38++ plasmablasts were isolated by single-cell sorting and costained with citrullinated peptide tetramers to identify ACPA-expressing plasmablasts. Cell-specific oligonucleotide barcodes were utilized, followed by large-scale sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, to obtain error-corrected, paired heavy- and light-chain antibody gene sequences for each B cell. Results: Bioinformatics analysis revealed 170 persistent plasmablast lineages in the RA blood, of which 19\% included multiple isotypes. Among IgG- and IgA-expressing plasmablasts, significantly more IgA-expressing than IgG-expressing persistent lineages were observed (P {\textless} 0.01). Shared complementarity-determining region 3 sequence motifs were identified across subjects. A subset of the plasmablast lineages included members derived from later time points with divergent somatic hypermutations that encoded antibodies that bind an expanded set of citrullinated antigens. Furthermore, these recombinant, differentially mutated plasmablast antibodies formed immune complexes that stimulated higher macrophage production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) compared to antibodies representing earlier time point–derived lineage members that were less mutated. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that established RA is characterized by a persistent IgA ACPA response that exhibits ongoing affinity maturation. This observation suggests the presence of a persistent mucosal antigen that continually promotes the production of IgA plasmablasts and their affinity maturation and epitope spreading, thus leading to the generation of ACPAs that bind additional citrullinated antigens and more potently stimulate macrophage production of TNF.},

Studying a single B cell disregards the majority of the humoral immune response, whereas bulk functional studies lack the necessary resolution to analyze the coexisting clonal diversity. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies and bioinformatics have made it possible to examine multiple co-evolving antibody monoclonal lineages within the context of a single repertoire. A plethora of accompanying methods and tools have been introduced in hopes of better understanding how pathogen presence dictates the global evolution of the antibody repertoire. Here, we provide a comprehensive summary of the tremendous progress of this newly emerging field of systems phylogeny of antibody responses.

While part of this diversity is generated by recombination during B-cell development and mutations during affinity maturation, the germ-line IG loci are also diverse across human populations and ethnicities. Recently, proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated genotype–phenotype correlations between specific IG germ-line variants and the quality of Ab responses during vaccination and disease. However, the functional consequences of IG genetic variation in Ab function and immunological outcomes remain underexplored. In this opinion article, we outline interconnections between IG genomic diversity and Ab-expressed repertoires and structure. We further propose a strategy for integrating IG genotyping with functional Ab profiling data as a means to better predict and optimize humoral responses in genetically diverse human populations, with immediate implications for personalized medicine. Genetic variation in human populations affects how individuals are able to mount functional antibody responses. Different alleles can encode convergent binding motifs that result in successful Ab responses against specific infections and vaccinations. Given the complexity of the IG loci and the diversity of the antibody repertoire, links between IG polymorphism and antibody repertoire variability have not been thoroughly explored.

Like the two D segments previously characterized (16, 17), all eight D segments are flanked by characteristic heptamers and nonamers separated by 12-bp spacers. These 10 D segments, and several more D segments identified but not yet sequenced, can be classified into three families based on the extent of sequence homology. The SP2 family consists of nine highly homologous D segments that are all 17-bp long and clustered in a chromosomal region of approximately 60 kb. The FL16 family consists of up to four D segments, two of which were mapped in the 5' end region of the SP2-D cluster. The two FL16D segments are 23 and 17 bp long. The third, the Q52 family, is a single-member family of the 10-bp-long DQ52, located 700 bp 5' to the JH cluster. We argue that the D-region sequences of the majority of heavy chain genes arise from these germline D segments by various somatic mechanisms, including joining of multiple D segments.

	abstract = {One of the central objectives in the field of phylodynamics is the quantification of population dynamic processes using genetic sequence data or in some cases phenotypic data. Phylodynamics has been successfully applied to many different processes, such as the spread of infectious diseases, within-host evolution of a pathogen, macroevolution and even language evolution. Phylodynamic analysis requires a probability distribution on phylogenetic trees spanned by the genetic data. Because such a probability distribution is not available for many common stochastic population dynamic processes, coalescent-based approximations assuming deterministic population size changes are widely employed. Key to many population dynamic models, in particular epidemiological models, is a period of exponential population growth during the initial phase. Here, we show that the coalescent does not well approximate stochastic exponential population growth, which is typically modelled by a birth–death process. We demonstrate that introducing demographic stochasticity into the population size function of the coalescent improves the approximation for values of R0 close to 1, but substantial differences remain for large R0. In addition, the computational advantage of using an approximation over exact models vanishes when introducing such demographic stochasticity. These results highlight that we need to increase efforts to develop phylodynamic tools that correctly account for the stochasticity of population dynamic models for inference.},

However, in this study, we show that alignment-free dissimilarity calculated based on sequencing samples can be overestimated compared with the dissimilarity calculated based on their genomes, and this bias can significantly decrease the performance of the alignment-free analysis.

	abstract = {Incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), the interaction between coalescence and speciation, is a process which generates incongruences between gene trees and species trees, as do gene duplication (D), transfer (T) and loss (L). These processes are usually modelled independently, but in reality, ILS can affect gene copy number polymorphism, i.e., interfere with DTL. This has been previously recognised, but not treated in a satisfactory way, mainly because DTL events are naturally modelled forward-in-time, while ILS requires backward-in-time coalescent modelling. Here we consider the joint action of ILS and DTL on the gene tree/species tree problem in all its complexity. In particular, we show that the interaction between ILS and duplications/transfers only can result in patterns usually interpreted as resulting from gene loss, and that the realised rate of D, T and L becomes non-homogeneous in time when ILS is taken into account. We introduce algorithmic solutions to these problems. Our new model, the {\textbackslash}emph\{multilocus multispecies coalescent\} (MLMSC), which also accounts for any level of linkage between loci, generalises the multispecies coalescent model and offers a versatile, powerful framework for proper simulation and inference of gene family evolution.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Motivation Species and gene trees represent how species and individual loci within their genomes evolve from their most recent common ancestors. These trees are central to addressing several questions in biology relating to, among other issues, species conservation, trait evolution and gene function. Consequently, their accurate inference from genomic data is a major endeavor. One approach to their inference is to co-estimate species and gene trees from genome-wide data. Indeed, Bayesian methods based on this approach already exist. However, these methods are very slow, limiting their applicability to datasets with small numbers of taxa. The more commonly used approach is to first infer gene trees individually, and then use gene tree estimates to infer the species tree. Methods in this category rely significantly on the accuracy of the gene trees which is often not high when the dataset includes closely related species. Results In this work, we introduce a simple, yet effective, iterative method for co-estimating gene and species trees from sequence data of multiple, unlinked loci. In every iteration, the method estimates a species tree, uses it as a generative process to simulate a collection of gene trees, and then selects gene trees for the individual loci from among the simulated gene trees by making use of the sequence data. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our method on simulated as well as biological data, and compare them to those of existing competing methods.

	abstract = {Inter-specific hybridization leading to abrupt speciation is a well-known, common mechanism in angiosperm evolution; only recently, however, have similar hybridization and speciation mechanisms been documented to occur frequently among the closely related group of sensu stricto Saccharomyces yeasts. The economically important lager beer yeast Saccharomyces pastorianus is such a hybrid, formed by the union of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces bayanus-related yeasts; efforts to understand its complex genome, searching for both biological and brewing-related insights, have been underway since its hybrid nature was first discovered. It had been generally thought that a single hybridization event resulted in a unique S. pastorianus species, but it has been recently postulated that there have been two or more hybridization events. Here, we show that there may have been two independent origins of S. pastorianus strains, and that each independent group - defined by characteristic genome rearrangements, copy number variations, ploidy differences, and DNA sequence polymorphisms - is correlated with specific breweries and/or geographic locations. Finally, by reconstructing common ancestral genomes via array-CGH data analysis and by comparing representative DNA sequences of the S. pastorianus strains with those of many different S. cerevisiae isolates, we have determined that the most likely S. cerevisiae ancestral parent for each of the independent S. pastorianus groups was an ale yeast, with different, but closely related ale strains contributing to each group's parentage. ©2008 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

	abstract = {Background: Next-generation sequencing technologies are rapidly generating whole-genome datasets for an increasing number of organisms. However, phylogenetic reconstruction of genomic data remains difficult because de novo assembly for non-model genomes and multi-genome alignment are challenging. Results: To greatly simplify the analysis, we present an Assembly and Alignment-Free (AAF) method (https:// sourceforge.net/projects/aaf-phylogeny) that constructs phylogenies directly from unassembled genome sequence data, bypassing both genome assembly and alignment. Using mathematical calculations, models of sequence evolution, and simulated sequencing of published genomes, we address both evolutionary and sampling issues caused by direct reconstruction, including homoplasy, sequencing errors, and incomplete sequencing coverage. From these results, we calculate the statistical properties of the pairwise distances between genomes, allowing us to optimize parameter selection and perform bootstrapping. As a test case with real data, we successfully reconstructed the phylogeny of 12 mammals using raw sequencing reads. We also applied AAF to 21 tropical tree genome datasets with low coverage to demonstrate its effectiveness on non-model organisms. Conclusion: Our AAF method opens up phylogenomics for species without an appropriate reference genome or high sequence coverage, and rapidly creates a phylogenetic framework for further analysis of genome structure and diversity among non-model organisms.},

	abstract = {We describe a novel method for efficient reconstruction of phylogenetic trees, based on sequences of whole genomes or proteomes, whose lengths may greatly vary. The core of our method is a new measure of pairwise distances between sequences. This measure is based on computing the average lengths of maximum common substrings, which is intrinsically related to information theoretic tools (Kullback-Leibler relative entropy). We present an algorithm for efficiently computing these distances. In principle, the distance of two ℓ long sequences can be calculated in O (ℓ) time. We implemented the algorithm using suffix arrays pur implementation is fast enough to enable the construction of the proteome phylogenomic tree for hundreds of species and the genome phylogenomic forest for almost two thousand viruses. An initial analysis of the results exhibits a remarkable agreement with "acceptable phylogenetic and taxonomic truth." To assess our approach, our results were compared to the traditional (single-gene or protein-based) maximum likelihood method. The obtained trees were compared to implementations of a number of alternative approaches, including two that were previously published in the literature, and to the published results of a third approach. Comparing their outcome and running time to ours, using a "traditional" trees and a standard tree comparison method, our algorithm improved upon the "competition" by a substantial margin. The simplicity and speed of our method allows for a whole genome analysis with the greatest scope attempted so far. We describe here five different applications of the method, which not only show the validity of the method, but also suggest a number of novel phylogenetic insights. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

They are related in spirit because all the ideas for sequence comparison try to use the information on the k-word distributions, Markov model or both. Motivated by adding k-word distributions to Markov model directly, we investigated two novel statistical measures for sequence comparison, called wre.k.r and S2.k.r. Results: The proposed measures were tested by similarity search, evaluation on functionally related regulatory sequences and phylogenetic analysis. This offers the systematic and quantitative experimental assessment of our measures. Moreover, we compared our achievements with these based on alignment or alignment-free. We grouped our experiments into two sets. The first one, performed via ROC (receiver operating curve) analysis, aims at assessing the intrinsic ability of our statistical measures to search for similar sequences from a database and discriminate functionally related regulatory sequences from unrelated sequences. The second one aims at assessing how well our statistical measure is used for phylogenetic analysis. The experimental assessment demonstrates that our similarity measures intending to incorporate k-word distributions into Markov model are more efficient. © The Author 2008.

	abstract = {Phylogenetic tree reconstruction requires construction of a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) from sequences. Computationally, it is difficult to achieve an optimal MSA for many sequences. Moreover, even if an optimal MSA is obtained, it may not be the true MSA that reflects the evolutionary history of the underlying sequences. Therefore, errors can be introduced during MSA construction which in turn affects the subsequent phylogenetic tree construction. In order to circumvent this issue, we extend the application of the k -tuple distance to phylogenetic tree reconstruction. The k -tuple distance between two sequences is the sum of the differences in frequency, over all possible tuples of length k, between the sequences and can be estimated without MSAs. It has been traditionally used to build a fast 'guide tree' to assist the construction of MSAs. Using the 1470 simulated sets of sequences generated under different evolutionary scenarios, the neighbor-joining trees and BioNJ trees, we compared the performance of the k -tuple distance with four commonly used distance estimators including Jukes-Cantor, Kimura, F84 and Tamura-Nei. These four distance estimators fall into the category of model-based distance estimators, as each of them takes account of a specific substitution model in order to compute the distance between a pair of already aligned sequences. Results show that trees constructed from the k -tuple distance are more accurate than those from other distances most time; when the divergence between underlying sequences is high, the tree accuracy could be twice or higher using the k -tuple distance than other estimators. Furthermore, as the k -tuple distance voids the need for constructing an MSA, it can save tremendous amount of time for phylogenetic tree reconstructions when the data include a large number of sequences. © 2008 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic studies aim to discover evolutionary relationships and histories. These studies are based on similarities of morphological characters and molecular sequences. Currently, widely accepted phylogenetic approaches are based on multiple sequence alignments, which analyze shared gene datasets and concatenate/coalesce these results to a final phylogeny with maximum support. However, these approaches still have limitations, and often have conflicting results with each other. Reconstructing ancestral genomes helps us understand mechanisms and corresponding consequences of evolution. Most existing genome level phylogeny and ancestor reconstruction methods can only process simplified real genome datasets or simulated datasets with identical genome content, unique genome markers, and limited types of evolutionary events. Here, we provide an alternative way to resolve phylogenetic problems based on analyses of real genome data. We use phylogenetic signals from all types of genome level evolutionary events, and overcome the conflicting issues existing in traditional phylogenetic approaches. Further, we build an automated computational pipeline to reconstruct phylogenies and ancestral genomes for two high-resolution real yeast genome datasets. Comparison results with recent studies and publications show that we reconstruct very accurate and robust phylogenies and ancestors. Finally, we identify and analyze the conserved syntenic blocks among reconstructed ancestral genomes and present yeast species.},

	abstract = {Green plants (Viridiplantae) include around 450,000–500,000 species1,2 of great diversity and have important roles in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Here, as part of the One Thousand Plant Transcriptomes Initiative, we sequenced the vegetative transcriptomes of 1,124 species that span the diversity of plants in a broad sense (Archaeplastida), including green plants (Viridiplantae), glaucophytes (Glaucophyta) and red algae (Rhodophyta). Our analysis provides a robust phylogenomic framework for examining the evolution of green plants. Most inferred species relationships are well supported across multiple species tree and supermatrix analyses, but discordance among plastid and nuclear gene trees at a few important nodes highlights the complexity of plant genome evolution, including polyploidy, periods of rapid speciation, and extinction. Incomplete sorting of ancestral variation, polyploidization and massive expansions of gene families punctuate the evolutionary history of green plants. Notably, we find that large expansions of gene families preceded the origins of green plants, land plants and vascular plants, whereas whole-genome duplications are inferred to have occurred repeatedly throughout the evolution of flowering plants and ferns. The increasing availability of high-quality plant genome sequences and advances in functional genomics are enabling research on genome evolution across the green tree of life.},

	abstract = {© The Author 2016. Placental mammals comprise three principal clades: Afrotheria (e.g., elephants and tenrecs), Xenarthra (e.g., armadillos and sloths), and Boreoeutheria (all other placental mammals), the relationships among which are the subject of controversy and a touchstone for debate on the limits of phylogenetic inference. Previous analyses have found support for all three hypotheses, leading some to conclude that this phylogenetic problem might be impossible to resolve due to the compounded effects of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and a rapid radiation. Here we show, using a genome scale nucleotide data set, microRNAs, and the reanalysis of the three largest previously published amino acid data sets, that the root of Placentalia lies between Atlantogenata and Boreoeutheria. Although we found evidence for ILS in early placental evolution, we are able to reject previous conclusions that the placental root is a hard polytomy that cannot be resolved. Reanalyses of previous data sets recover Atlantogenata + Boreoeutheria and show that contradictory results are a consequence of poorly fitting evolutionary models; instead, when the evolutionary process is better-modeled, all data sets converge on Atlantogenata. Our Bayesian molecular clock analysis estimates that marsupials diverged from placentals 157-170 Ma, crown Placentalia diverged 86-100 Ma, and crown Atlantogenata diverged 84-97 Ma. Our results are compatible with placental diversification being driven by dispersal rather than vicariance mechanisms, postdating early phases in the protracted opening of the Atlantic Ocean.},

ASTRAL is a leading method for inferring species trees given gene trees while accounting for incomplete lineage sorting. It finds the tree that shares the maximum number of quartets with input trees, drawing bipartitions from a predefined set of bipartitions X. In this paper, we introduce ASTRAL-III, which substantially improves on ASTRAL-II in terms of running time by handling polytomies more efficiently, exploiting similarities between gene trees, and trimming unnecessary parts of the search space. The asymptotic running time in the presence of polytomies is reduced from \$\$O(n{\textasciicircum}3k{\textbar}X{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}\{\{1.726\}\})\$\$ for n species and k genes to \$\$O(D{\textbar}X{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}\{1.726\})\$\$ where \$\$D=O(nk)\$\$ is the sum of degrees of all unique nodes in input trees. ASTRAL-III enables us to test whether contracting low support branches in gene trees improves the accuracy by reducing noise. In extensive simulations and on real data, we show that removing branches with very low support improves accuracy while overly aggressive filtering is harmful.},

Given this solution, we then use non-parametric statistics to find an outlier set of taxa that have an unexpectedly high impact on the tree diameter. We test our method, TreeShrink, on five biological datasets, and show that it is more conservative than rogue taxon removal using RogueNaRok.

	abstract = {We develop a Bayesian method for inferring the species phylogeny under the multispecies coalescent (MSC) model. To improve the mixing properties of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that traverses the space of species trees, we implement two efficient MCMC proposals: The first is based on the Subtree Pruning and Regrafting (SPR) algorithm and the second is based on a node-slider algorithm. Like the Nearest-Neighbor Interchange (NNI) algorithm we implemented previously, both new algorithms propose changes to the species tree, while simultaneously altering the gene trees at multiple genetic loci to automatically avoid conflicts with the newly proposed species tree. The method integrates over gene trees, naturally taking account of the uncertainty of gene tree topology and branch lengths given the sequence data. A simulation study was performed to examine the statistical properties of the new method. The method was found to show excellent statistical performance, inferring the correct species tree with near certainty when 10 loci were included in the dataset. The prior on species trees has some impact, particularly for small numbers of loci. We analyzed several previously published datasets (both real and simulated) for rattlesnakes and Philippine shrews, in comparison with alternative methods. The results suggest that the Bayesian coalescent-based method is statistically more efficient than heuristic methods based on summary statistics, and that our implementation is computationally more efficient than alternative full-likelihood methods under theMSC. Parameter estimates for the rattlesnake data suggest drastically different evolutionary dynamics between the nuclear and mitochondrial loci, even though they support largely consistent species trees. We discuss the different challenges facing the marginal likelihood calculation and transmodel MCMC as alternative strategies for estimating posterior probabilities for species trees.},

Until now, those problems were solved by MCMC estimation algorithms. Second, we extend the gene evolution model to the gene sequence evolution model, by including sequence evolution. Third, we develop MCMC algorithms for the gene sequence evolution model that, given gene sequence data allows: (1) orthology analysis, reconciliation analysis, and gene tree reconstruction, w.r.t. a species tree, that balances a likely/unlikely reconciliation and a likely/unlikely gene tree and (2) species tree reconstruction that balance a likely /unlikely reconciliation and a likely/unlikely gene trees. These MCMC algorithms take advantage of the exact algorithms for the gene evolution model. We have successfully tested our dynamical programming algorithms on real data for a biogeography problem.

	doi = {10.1089/cmb.2013.0073},
	abstract = {Phylogenetic tree reconciliation is a powerful approach for inferring evolutionary events like gene duplication, horizontal gene transfer, and gene loss, which are fundamental to our understanding of molecular evolution. While duplication-loss (DL) reconciliation leads to a unique maximum-parsimony solution, duplication-transfer-loss (DTL) reconciliation yields a multitude of optimal solutions, making it difficult to infer the true evolutionary history of the gene family. This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that different event cost assignments yield different sets of optimal reconciliations. Here, we present an effective, efficient, and scalable method for dealing with these fundamental problems in DTL reconciliation. Our approach works by sampling the space of optimal reconciliations uniformly at random and aggregating the results. We show that even gene trees with only a few dozen genes often have millions of optimal reconciliations and present an algorithm to efficiently sample the space of optimal reconciliations uniformly at random in O(mn 2) time per sample, where m and n denote the number of genes and species, respectively. We use these samples to understand how different optimal reconciliations vary in their node mappings and event assignments and to investigate the impact of varying event costs. We apply our method to a biological dataset of approximately 4700 gene trees from 100 taxa and observe that 93\% of event assignments and 73\% of mappings remain consistent across different multiple optima. Our analysis represents the first systematic investigation of the space of optimal DTL reconciliations and has many important implications for the study of gene family evolution. © 2013 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

We then study a natural extension of this problem: what is the minimum number of gene losses involved in an evolutionary history leading to an observed gene tree or set of gene trees? Based on our characterization of DS-trees, we propose a heuristic for this problem, and evaluate it on a dataset of plants gene families and on simulated data. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2008.},

We describe a procedure to detect and document the phylogenetic distribution of orthologs allowing researchers to use this information to guide selection of loci best suited to test specific evolutionary questions. At the core of this pipeline is a new phylogenetic orthology method that is neither affected by the position of the root nor requires explicit assignment of outgroups. We discuss the properties of this new orthology assessment method and exemplify its utility for phylogenomics using a small insects dataset. In addition, we exemplify the pipeline to identify and document stable orthologs for the group of orb-weaving spiders (Araneoidea) using RNAseq data.

Phylogenomic data sets commonly include transcriptomes and low-coverage genomes that are incomplete and contain errors and isoforms. These properties can severely violate the underlying assumptions of orthology inference with existing heuristics. We present a procedure that uses phylogenies for both homology and orthology assignment. The procedure first uses similarity scores to infer putative homologs that are then aligned, constructed into phylogenies, and pruned of spurious branches caused by deep paralogs, misassembly, frameshifts, or recombination. These final homologs are then used to identify orthologs. We explore four alternative tree-based orthology inference approaches, of which two are new. These accommodate gene and genome duplications as well as gene tree discordance. We demonstrate these methods in three published data sets including the grape family, Hymenoptera, and millipedes with divergence times ranging from approximately 100 to over 400 Ma. The procedure significantly increased the completeness and accuracy of the inferred homologs and orthologs. We also found that data sets that are more recently diverged and/or include more high-coverage genomes had more complete sets of orthologs. To explicitly evaluate sources of conflicting phylogenetic signals, we applied serial jackknife analyses of gene regions keeping each locus intact. The methods described here can scale to over 100 taxa. They have been implemented in python with independent scripts for each step, making it easy to modify or incorporate them into existing pipelines.

The species delimitation requires no a priori assignment of individuals to species, and no guide tree. The method is implemented in a package called STACEY for BEAST2, and is a extension of the author’s DISSECT package. Here we demonstrate considerable efficiency improvements by using three new operators for sampling from the posterior using the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, and by using a model for the population size parameters along the branches of the species tree which allows these parameters to be integrated out. The correctness of the moves is demonstrated by tests of the implementation. The practice of using a pipeline approach to species delimitation under the multispecies coalescent, has been shown to have major problems on simulated data (Olave et al. in Syst Biol 63:263–271. doi:10.1093/sysbio/syt106, 2014). The same simulated data set is used to demonstrate the accuracy and improved convergence of the present method.

We provide here the requisite framework for addressing these key questions. Because both phenotypic and molecular data can be analyzed in a common Bayesian framework with our program iBPP, we can compare the accuracy of delimited taxa based on genetic data alone versus when integrated with phenotypic data. We can also evaluate how the integration of phenotypic data might improve species delimitation when divergence occurs with gene flow and/or is selectively driven. These two realities of the speciation process are ignored by currently available genetic approaches. Our model accommodates phenotypic characters that exhibit different degrees of divergence, allowing for both neutral traits and traits under selection. We found a greater accuracy of estimated species boundaries with the integration of phenotypic and genetic data, with a strong beneficial influence of phenotypic data from traits under selection when the speciation process involves gene flow. Our results highlight the benefits of multiple data types, but also draws into question the rationale of species delimitation based exclusively on genetic data.},

We introduce a parametric model that relaxes the molecular clock by allowing rates to vary across lineages according to a compound Poisson process. Events of substitution rate change are placed onto a phylogenetic tree according to a Poisson process. When an event of substitution rate change occurs, the current rate of substitution is modified by a gamma-distributed random variable. Parameters of the model can be estimated using Bayesian inference. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo integration to evaluate the posterior probability distribution because the posterior probability involves high dimensional integrals and summations. Specifically, we use the Metropolis-Hastings-Green algorithm with 11 different move types to evaluate the posterior distribution. We demonstrate the method by analyzing a complete mtDNA sequence data set from 23 mammals. The model presented here has several potential advantages over other models that have been proposed to relax the clock because it is parametric and does not assume that rates change only at speciation events. This model should prove useful for estimating divergence times when substitution rates vary across lineages.},

Increasingly larger datasets encompassing greater taxonomic diversity are becoming available to generate molecular timetrees by using sophisticated methods that model rate variation among lineages. However, the practical application of these methods is challenging because of the exorbitant calculation times required by current methods for contemporary data sizes, the difficulty in correctly modeling the rate heterogeneity in highly diverse taxonomic groups, and the lack of reliable clock calibrations and their uncertainty distributions for most groups of species. Here, we present a method that estimates relative times of divergences for all branching points (nodes) in very large phylogenetic trees without assuming a specific model for lineage rate variation or specifying any clock calibrations. The method (RelTime) performed better than existing methods when applied to very large computer simulated datasets where evolutionary rates were varied extensively among lineages by following autocorrelated and uncorrelated models. On average, RelTime completed calculations 1,000 times faster than the fastest Bayesian method, with even greater speed difference for larger number of sequences. This speed and accuracy will enable molecular dating analysis of very large datasets. Relative time estimates will be useful for determining the relative ordering and spacing of speciation events, identifying lineages with significantly slower or faster evolutionary rates, diagnosing the effect of selected calibrations on absolute divergence times, and estimating absolute times of divergence when highly reliable calibration points are available.},

	abstract = {A fundamental observation of comparative genomics is that the distribution of evolution rates across the complete sets of orthologous genes in pairs of related genomes remains virtually unchanged throughout the evolution of life, from bacteria to mammals. The most straightforward explanation for the conservation of this distribution appears to be that the relative evolution rates of all genes remain nearly constant, or in other words, that evolutionary rates of different genes are strongly correlated within each evolving genome. This correlation could be explained by a model that we denoted Universal PaceMaker (UPM) of genome evolution. The UPM model posits that the rate of evolution changes synchronously across genome-wide sets of genes in all evolving lineages. Alternatively, however, the correlation between the evolutionary rates of genes could be a simple consequence of molecular clock (MC). We sought to differentiate between the MC and UPM models by fitting thousands of phylogenetic trees for bacterial and archaeal genes to supertrees that reflect the dominant trend of vertical descent in the evolution of archaea and bacteria and that were constrained according to the two models. The goodness of fit for the UPM model was better than the fit for the MC model, with overwhelming statistical significance, although similarly to the MC, the UPM is strongly overdispersed. Thus, the results of this analysis reveal a universal, genome-wide pacemaker of evolution that could have been in operation throughout the history of life.},

In previous work assessing the performance of species delimitation under this model, speciation was treated as an instantaneous event rather than as an extended process involving distinct phases of speciation initiation (structuring) and completion. Here, we use data under simulations that explicitly model speciation as an extended process rather than an instantaneous event and carry out species delimitation inference on these data under the multispecies coalescent. We show that the multispecies coalescent diagnoses genetic structure, not species, and that it does not statistically distinguish structure associated with population isolation vs. species boundaries. Because of the misidentification of population structure as putative species, our work raises questions about the practice of genome-based species discovery, with cascading consequences in other fields. Specifically, all fields that rely on species as units of analysis, from conservation biology to studies of macroevolutionary dynamics, will be impacted by inflated estimates of the number of species, especially as genomic resources provide unprecedented power for detecting increasingly finer-scaled genetic structure under the multispecies coalescent. As such, our work also represents a general call for systematic study to reconsider a reliance on genomic data alone. Until new methods are developed that can discriminate between structure due to population-level processes and that due to species boundaries, genomic-based results should only be considered a hypothesis that requires validation of delimited species with multiple data types, such as phenotypic and ecological information.},

Compiling a public library of DNA barcodes linked to named specimens could provide a new master key for identifying species, one whose power will rise with increased taxon coverage and with faster, cheaper sequencing. Recent work suggests that sequence diversity in a 648-bp region of the mitochondrial gene, cytochrome c oxidase I (COI), might serve as a DNA barcode for the identification of animal species. This study tested the effectiveness of a COI barcode in discriminating bird species, one of the largest and best-studied vertebrate groups. We determined COI barcodes for 260 species of North American birds and found that distinguishing species was generally straightforward. All species had a different COI barcode(s), and the differences between closely related species were, on average, 18 times higher than the differences within species. Our results identified four probable new species of North American birds, suggesting that a global survey will lead to the recognition of many additional bird species. The finding of large COI sequence differences between, as compared to small differences within, species confirms the effectiveness of COI barcodes for the identification of bird species. This result plus those from other groups of animals imply that a standard screening threshold of sequence difference (10x average intraspecific difference) could speed the discovery of new animal species. The growing evidence for the effectiveness of DNA barcodes as a basis for species identification supports an international exercise that has recently begun to assemble a comprehensive library of COI sequences linked to named specimens.},

However, Bayesian species delimitation methods typically require brute force integration over gene trees via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which introduces a large computation burden and precludes their application to genomic-scale data. Here we combine a recently introduced dynamic programming algorithm for estimating species trees that bypasses MCMC integration over gene trees with sophisticated methods for estimating marginal likelihoods, needed for Bayesian model selection, to provide a rigorous and computationally tractable technique for genome-wide species delimitation. We provide a critical yet simple correction that brings the likelihoods of different species trees, and more importantly their corresponding marginal likelihoods, to the same common denominator, which enables direct and accurate comparisons of competing species delimitation models using Bayes factors. We test this approach, which we call Bayes factor delimitation (*with genomic data; BFD*), using common species delimitation scenarios with computer simulations. Varying the numbers of loci and the number of samples suggest that the approach can distinguish the true model even with few loci and limited samples per species. Misspecification of the prior for population size θ has little impact on support for the true model. We apply the approach to West African forest geckos (Hemidactylus fasciatus complex) using genome-wide SNP data. This new Bayesian method for species delimitation builds on a growing trend for objective species delimitation methods with explicit model assumptions that are easily tested.

	abstract = {Several models have been proposed to relax the molecular clock in order to estimate divergence times. However, it is unclear which model has the best fit to real data and should therefore be used to perform molecular dating. In particular, we do not know whether rate autocorrelation should be considered or which prior on divergence times should be used. In this work, we propose a general bench mark of alternative relaxed clock models. We have reimplemented most of the already existing models, including the popular lognormal model, as well as various prior choices for divergence times (birth-death, Dirichlet, uniform), in a common Bayesian statistical framework. We also propose a new autocorrelated model, called the "CIR" process, with well-defined stationary properties. We assess the relative fitness of these models and priors, when applied to 3 different protein data sets from eukaryotes, vertebrates, and mammals, by computing Bayes factors using a numerical method called thermodynamic integration. We find that the 2 autocorrelated models, CIR and lognormal, have a similar fit and clearly outperform uncorrelated models on all 3 data sets. In contrast, the optimal choice for the divergence time prior is more dependent on the data investigated. Altogether, our results provide useful guidelines for model choice in the field of molecular dating while opening the way to more extensive model comparisons. © The Author 2007.

	abstract = {Molecular dating techniques require the use of calibrations, which are usually fossil or geological vicariance-based. Fossil calibrations have been criticised because they result only in minimum age estimates. Based on a historical biogeographic perspective, I suggest that vicariance-based calibrations are more dangerous. Almost all analytical methods in historical biogeography are strongly biased towards inferring vicariance, hence vicariance identified through such methods is unreliable. Other studies, especially of groups found on Gondwanan fragments, have simply assumed vicariance. Although it was previously believed that vicariance was the predominant mode of speciation, mounting evidence now indicates that speciation by dispersal is common, dominating vicariance in several groups. Moreover, the possibility of speciation having occurred before the said geological event cannot be precluded. Thus, geological calibrations can under- or overestimate times, whereas fossil calibrations always result in minimum estimates. Another major drawback of vicariant calibrations is the problem of circular reasoning when the resulting estimates are used to infer ages of biogeographic events. I argue that fossil-based dating is a superior alternative to vicariance, primarily because the strongest assumption in the latter, that speciation was caused by the said geological process, is more often than not the most tenuous. When authors prefer to use a combination of fossil and vicariant calibrations, one suggestion is to report results both with and without inclusion of the geological constraints. Relying solely on vicariant calibrations should be strictly avoided. © 2011 Current Zoology.},

There is now a general appreciation that the procedure of divergence dating is considerably more complex than that initially described in the 1960s by Zuckerkandl and Pauling (1962, 1965). In particular, there has been much critical attention toward the assumption of a global molecular clock, resulting in the development of increasingly sophisticated techniques for inferring divergence times from sequence data. In response to the documentation of widespread departures from clocklike behavior, a variety of local- and relaxed-clock methods have been proposed and implemented. Local-clock methods permit different molecular clocks in different parts of the phylogenetic tree, thereby retaining the advantages of the classical molecular clock while casting off the restrictive assumption of a single, global rate of substitution},

	abstract = {In Bayesian divergence time estimation methods, incorporating calibrating information from the fossil record is commonly done by assigning prior densities to ancestral nodes in the tree. Calibration prior densities are typically parametric distributions offset by minimum age estimates provided by the fossil record. Specification of the parameters of calibration densities requires the user to quantify his or her prior knowledge of the age of the ancestral node relative to the age of its calibrating fossil. The values of these parameters can, potentially, result in biased estimates of node ages if they lead to overly informative prior distributions. Accordingly, determining parameter values that lead to adequate prior densities is not straightforward. In this study, I present a hierarchical Bayesian model for calibrating divergence time analyses with multiple fossil age constraints. This approach applies a Dirichlet process prior as a hyperprior on the parameters of calibration prior densities. Specifically, this model assumes that the rate parameters of exponential prior distributions on calibrated nodes are distributed according to a Dirichlet process, whereby the rate parameters are clustered into distinct parameter categories. Both simulated and biological data are analyzed to evaluate the performance of the Dirichlet process hyperprior. Compared with fixed exponential prior densities, the hierarchical Bayesian approach results in more accurate and precise estimates of internal node ages. When this hyperprior is applied using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, the ages of calibrated nodes are sampled from mixtures of exponential distributions and uncertainty in the values of calibration density parameters is taken into account.},

	abstract = {Background: Relaxed molecular clock models allow divergence time dating and "relaxed phylogenetic" inference, in which a time tree is estimated in the face of unequal rates across lineages. We present a new method for relaxing the assumption of a strict molecular clock using Markov chain Monte Carlo to implement Bayesian modeling averaging over random local molecular clocks. The new method approaches the problem of rate variation among lineages by proposing a series of local molecular clocks, each extending over a subregion of the full phylogeny. Each branch in a phylogeny (subtending a clade) is a possible location for a change of rate from one local clock to a new one. Thus, including both the global molecular clock and the unconstrained model results, there are a total of 22n-2possible rate models available for averaging with 1, 2, ..., 2n - 2 different rate categories.Results: We propose an efficient method to sample this model space while simultaneously estimating the phylogeny. The new method conveniently allows a direct test of the strict molecular clock, in which one rate rules them all, against a large array of alternative local molecular clock models. We illustrate the method's utility on three example data sets involving mammal, primate and influenza evolution. Finally, we explore methods to visualize the complex posterior distribution that results from inference under such models.Conclusions: The examples suggest that large sequence datasets may only require a small number of local molecular clocks to reconcile their branch lengths with a time scale.

	abstract = {In phylogenetics, the unrooted model of phylogeny and the strict molecular clock model are two extremes of a continuum. Despite their dominance in phylogenetic inference, it is evident that both are biologically unrealistic and that the real evolutionary process lies between these two extremes. Fortunately, intermediate models employing relaxed molecular clocks have been described. These models open the gate to a new field of "relaxed phylogenetics." Here we introduce a new approach to performing relaxed phylogenetic analysis. We describe how it can be used to estimate phylogenies and divergence times in the face of uncertainty in evolutionary rates and calibration times. Our approach also provides a means for measuring the clocklikeness of datasets and comparing this measure between different genes and phylogenies. We find no significant rate autocorrelation among branches in three large datasets, suggesting that autocorrelated models are not necessarily suitable for these data. In addition, we place these datasets on the continuum of clocklikeness between a strict molecular clock and the alternative unrooted extreme. Finally, we present analyses of 102 bacterial, 106 yeast, 61 plant, 99 metazoan, and 500 primate alignments. From these we conclude that our method is phylogenetically more accurate and precise than the traditional unrooted model while adding the ability to infer a timescale to evolution. © 2006 Drummond et al.},

	abstract = {Background. In recent years there has been a trend of leaving the strict molecular clock in order to infer dating of speciations and other evolutionary events. Explicit modeling of substitution rates and divergence times makes formulation of informative prior distributions for branch lengths possible. Models with birth-death priors on tree branching and auto-correlated or iid substitution rates among lineages have been proposed, enabling simultaneous inference of substitution rates and divergence times. This problem has, however, mainly been analysed in the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework, an approach requiring computation times of hours or days when applied to large phylogenies. Results. We demonstrate that a hill-climbing maximum a posteriori (MAP) adaptation of the MCMC scheme results in considerable gain in computational efficiency. We demonstrate also that a novel dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for branch length factorization, useful both in the hill-climbing and in the MCMC setting, further reduces computation time. For the problem of inferring rates and times parameters on a fixed tree, we perform simulations, comparisons between hill-climbing and MCMC on a plant rbcL gene dataset, and dating analysis on an animal mtDNA dataset, showing that our methodology enables efficient, highly accurate analysis of very large trees. Datasets requiring a computation time of several days with MCMC can with our MAP algorithm be accurately analysed in less than a minute. From the results of our example analyses, we conclude that our methodology generally avoids getting trapped early in local optima. For the cases where this nevertheless can be a problem, for instance when we in addition to the parameters also infer the tree topology, we show that the problem can be evaded by using a simulated-annealing like (SAL) method in which we favour tree swaps early in the inference while biasing our focus towards rate and time parameter changes later on. Conclusion. Our contribution leaves the field open for fast and accurate dating analysis of nucleotide sequence data. Modeling branch substitutions rates and divergence times separately allows us to include birth-death priors on the times without the assumption of a molecular clock. The methodology is easily adapted to take data from fossil records into account and it can be used together with a broad range of rate and substitution models. © 2008 Åkerborg et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

METHODS: We considered 313 HIV-infected individuals for whom reliable estimates of infection dates and next-generation sequencing (NGS)-derived nucleotide frequency data were available. Fractions of ambiguous nucleotides, obtained by population sequencing, were available for 207 samples. We assessed whether the average pairwise diversity calculated using NGS sequences provided a more exact prediction of the time since infection and classification of infection recency ({\textless}1 year after infection), compared with the fraction of ambiguous nucleotides. RESULTS: NGS-derived average pairwise diversity classified an infection as recent with a sensitivity of 88\% and a specificity of 85\%. When considering only the 207 samples for which fractions of ambiguous nucleotides were available, the NGS-derived average pairwise diversity exhibited a higher sensitivity (90\% vs 78\%) and specificity (95\% vs 67\%) than the fraction of ambiguous nucleotides. Additionally, the average pairwise diversity could be used to estimate the time since infection with a mean absolute error of 0.84 years, compared with 1.03 years for the fraction of ambiguous nucleotides. CONCLUSIONS: Viral diversity based on NGS data is more precise than that based on population sequencing in its ability to predict infection recency and provides an estimated time since infection that has a mean absolute error of {\textless}1 year.},

The understanding of viruses as quasispecies has led to new antiviral designs, such as lethal mutagenesis, whose aim is to drive viruses toward low fitness values with limited chances of fitness recovery. The impact of quasispecies for three salient human pathogens, human immunodeficiency virus and the hepatitis B and C viruses, is reviewed, with emphasis on antiviral treatment strategies.

	abstract = {Virus populations can display high genetic diversity within individual hosts. The intra-host collection of viral haplotypes, called viral quasispecies, is an important determinant of virulence, pathogenesis, and treatment outcome. We present HaploClique, a computational approach to reconstruct the structure of a viral quasispecies from next-generation sequencing data as obtained from bulk sequencing of mixed virus samples. We develop a statistical model for paired-end reads accounting for mutations, insertions, and deletions. Using an iterative maximal clique enumeration approach, read pairs are assembled into haplotypes of increasing length, eventually enabling global haplotype assembly. The performance of our quasispecies assembly method is assessed on simulated data for varying population characteristics and sequencing technology parameters. Owing to its paired-end handling, HaploClique compares favorably to state-of-the-art haplotype inference methods. It can reconstruct error-free full-length haplotypes from low coverage samples and detect large insertions and deletions at low frequencies. We applied HaploClique to sequencing data derived from a clinical hepatitis C virus population of an infected patient and discovered a novel deletion of length 357±167 bp that was validated by two independent long-read sequencing experiments.

	abstract = {To understand the high variability of the asymptomatic interval between primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and the development of AIDS, we studied the evolution of the C2-V5 region of the HIV-1 env gene and of T-cell subsets in nine men with a moderate or slow rate of disease progression. They were monitored from the time of seroconversion for a period of 6 to 12 years until the development of advanced disease in seven men. Based on the analysis of viral divergence from the founder strain, viral population diversity within sequential time points, and the outgrowth of viruses capable of utilizing the CXCR4 receptor (X4 viruses), the existence of three distinct phases within the asymptomatic interval is suggested: an early phase of variable duration during which linear increases ( approximately 1\% per year) in both divergence and diversity were observed; an intermediate phase lasting an average of 1.8 years, characterized by a continued increase in divergence but with stabilization or decline in diversity; and a late phase characterized by a slowdown or stabilization of divergence and continued stability or decline in diversity. X4 variants emerged around the time of the early- to intermediate-phase transition and then achieved peak representation and began a decline around the transition between the intermediate and late phases. The late-phase transition was also associated with failure of T-cell homeostasis (defined by a downward inflection in CD3(+) T cells) and decline of CD4(+) T cells to {\textless}/=200 cells/microliter. The strength of these temporal associations between viral divergence and diversity, viral coreceptor specificity, and T-cell homeostasis and subset composition supports the concept that the phases described represent a consistent pattern of viral evolution during the course of HIV-1 infection in moderate progressors. Recognition of this pattern may help explain previous conflicting data on the relationship between viral evolution and disease progression and may provide a useful framework for evaluating immune damage and recovery in untreated and treated HIV-1 infections.},

	abstract = {A new method for estimating divergence times when evolutionary rates are variable across lineages is proposed. The method, called nonparametric rate smoothing (NPRS), relies on minimization of ancestor-descendant local rate changes and is motivated by the likelihood that evolutionary rates are autocorrelated in time. Fossil information pertaining to minimum and/or maximum ages of nodes in a phylogeny is incorporated into the algorithms by constrained optimization techniques. The accuracy of NPRS was examined by comparison to a clock-based maximum-likelihood method in computer simulations. NPRS provides more accurate estimates of divergence times when (1) sequence lengths are sufficiently long, (2) rates are truly nonclocklike, and (3) rates are moderately to highly autocorrelated in time. The algorithms were applied to estimate divergence times in seed plants based on data from the chloroplast rbcL gene. Both constrained and unconstrained NPRS methods tended to produce divergence time estimates more consistent with paleobotanical evidence than did clock-based estimates.},

Recently proposed estimation procedures have mainly adopted highly parametric approaches that model rate evolution explicitly. In this study, a semiparametric smoothing method is developed using penalized likelihood. A saturated model in which every lineage has a separate rate is combined with a roughness penalty that discourages rates from varying too much across a phylogeny. A data-driven cross-validation criterion is then used to determine an optimal level of smoothing. This criterion is based on an estimate of the average prediction error associated with pruning lineages from the tree.

	abstract = {BackgroundMolecular dating has gained ever-increasing interest since the molecular clock hypothesis was proposed in the 1960s. Molecular dating provides detailed temporal frameworks for divergence events in phylogenetic trees, allowing diverse evolutionary questions to be addressed. The key aspect of the molecular clock hypothesis, namely that differences in DNA or protein sequence between two species are proportional to the time elapsed since they diverged, was soon shown to be untenable. Other approaches were proposed to take into account rate heterogeneity among lineages, but the calibration process, by which relative times are transformed into absolute ages, has received little attention until recently. New methods have now been proposed to resolve potential sources of error associated with the calibration of phylogenetic trees, particularly those involving use of the fossil record.Scope and ConclusionsThe use of the fossil record as a source of independent information in the calibration process is the main focus of this paper; other sources of calibration information are also discussed. Particularly error-prone aspects of fossil calibration are identified, such as fossil dating, the phylogenetic placement of the fossil and the incompleteness of the fossil record. Methods proposed to tackle one or more of these potential error sources are discussed (e.g. fossil cross-validation, prior distribution of calibration points and confidence intervals on the fossil record). In conclusion, the fossil record remains the most reliable source of information for the calibration of phylogenetic trees, although associated assumptions and potential bias must be taken into account.},

Here, we use mitochondrial DNA variation to delimit species in a poorly known beetle radiation in the genus Rivacindela from arid Australia. Among 468 individuals sampled from 65 sites and multiple morphologically distinguishable types, sequence variation in three mtDNA genes (cytochrome oxidase subunit 1, cytochrome b, 16S ribosomal RNA) was strongly partitioned between 46 or 47 putative species identified with quantitative methods of species recognition based on fixed unique ("diagnostic") characters. The boundaries between groups were also recognizable from a striking increase in branching rate in clock-constrained calibrated trees. Models of stochastic lineage growth (Yule models) were combined with coalescence theory to develop a new likelihood method that determines the point of transition from species-level (speciation and extinction) to population-level (coalescence) evolutionary processes. Fitting the location of the switches from speciation to coalescent nodes on the ultrametric tree of Rivacindela produced a transition in branching rate occurring at 0.43 Mya, leading to an estimate of 48 putative species (confidence interval for the threshold ranging from 47 to 51 clusters within 2 logL units). Entities delimited in this way exhibited biological properties of traditionally defined species, showing coherence of geographic ranges, broad congruence with morphologically recognized species, and levels of sequence divergence typical for closely related species of insects. The finding of discontinuous evolutionary groupings that are readily apparent in patterns of sequence variation permits largely automated species delineation from DNA surveys of local communities as a scaffold for taxonomy in this poorly known insect group.},

	abstract = {A Bayesian coalescent-based method has recently been proposed to delimit species using multilocus genetic sequence data. Posterior probabilities of different species delimitation models are calculated using reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. The method accounts for species phylogenies and coalescent events in both extant and extinct species and accommodates lineage sorting and uncertainties in the gene trees. Although the method is theoretically appealing, its utility in practical data analysis is yet to be rigorously examined. In particular, the analysis may be sensitive to priors on ancestral population sizes and on species divergence times and to gene flow between species. Here we conduct a computer simulation to evaluate the statistical performance of the method, such as the false negatives (the error of lumping multiple species into one) and false positives (the error of splitting one species into several). We found that the correct species model was inferred with high posterior probability with only one or two loci when 5 or 10 sequences were sampled from each population, or with 50 loci when only one sequence was sampled. We also simulated data allowing migration under a two-species model, a mainland-island model and a stepping-stone model to assess the impact of gene flow (hybridization or introgression). The behavior of the method was diametrically different depending on the migration rate. Low rates at {\textless} 0.1 migrants per generation had virtually no effect, so that the method, while assuming no hybridization between species, identified distinct species despite small amounts of gene flow. This behavior appears to be consistent with biologists' practice. In contrast, higher migration rates at ≥ 10 migrants per generation caused the method to infer one species. At intermediate levels of migration, the method is indecisive. Our results suggest that Bayesian analysis under the multispecies coalescent model may provide important insights into population divergences, and may be useful for generating hypotheses of species delimitation, to be assessed with independent information from anatomical, behavioral, and ecological data. © 2011 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {A method was developed for simultaneous Bayesian inference of species delimitation and species phylogeny using the multispecies coalescent model. The method eliminates the need for a user-specified guide tree in species delimitation and incorporates phylogenetic uncertainty in a Bayesian framework. The nearest-neighbor interchange algorithm was adapted to propose changes to the species tree, with the gene trees for multiple loci altered in the proposal to avoid conflicts with the newly proposed species tree. We also modify our previous scheme for specifying priors for species delimitation models to construct joint priors for models of species delimitation and species phylogeny. As in our earlier method, the modified algorithm integrates over gene trees, taking account of the uncertainty of gene tree topology and branch lengths given the sequence data. We conducted a simulation study to examine the statistical properties of the method using six populations (two sequences each) and a true number of three species, with values of divergence times and ancestral population sizes that are realistic for recently diverged species. The results suggest that the method tends to be conservative with high posterior probabilities being a confident indicator of species status. Simulation results also indicate that the power of the method to delimit species increases with an increase of the divergence times in the species tree, and with an increased number of gene loci. Reanalyses of two data sets of cavefish and coast horned lizards suggest considerable phylogenetic uncertainty even though the data are informative about species delimitation. We discuss the impact of the prior on models of species delimitation and species phylogeny and of the prior on population size parameters (Θ) on Bayesian species delimitation.},

The problem is known to be difficult because of the extent of divergence between this diverse group of gymnosperms and their closest phylogenetic relatives. Here, we investigate the evolutionary properties of conifer chloroplast DNA sequences. To improve taxon sampling of Cupressophyta (non-Pinaceae conifers), we report sequences from three new chloroplast (cp) genomes of Southern Hemisphere conifers. We have applied a site pattern sorting criterion to study compositional heterogeneity, heterotachy, and the fit of conifer chloroplast genome sequences to a general time reversible + G substitution model. We show that non-time reversible properties of aligned sequence positions in the chloroplast genomes of Gnetales mislead phylogenetic reconstruction of these seed plants. When 2,250 of the most varied sites in our concatenated alignment are excluded, phylogenetic analyses favor a close evolutionary relationship between the Gnetales and Pinaceae-the Gnepine hypothesis.

To elucidate the Gnetales position, an improved amino acid substitution matrix was estimated based on 64 chloroplast (cp) genomes and was applied to cp genome data including all three lineages of Gnetales in maximum likelihood analyses of proteins. Although the initial analysis strongly supported the sister relation of Gnetales with Cryptomeria (Cupressophyta or non-Pinaceae conifers) (the "Gnecup" hypothesis), the support seems to be caused by a long-branch attraction (LBA) artifact. Indeed, by removing fastest evolving proteins that are most likely associated with the LBA, the support drastically declined. Furthermore, another analysis of partial genome data with dense taxon sampling of conifers showed that, in psbC, rpl2, and rps7 proteins, there are many parallel amino acid substitutions between the lineages leading to Gnetales and to Cryptomeria, and by further excluding these three genes, the sister relation of Gnetales with Pinaceae (the "Gnepine" hypothesis) became supported. Overall, our analyses indicate that the LBA and parallel substitutions cause a seriously biased inference of phylogenetic position of Gnetales with the cp genome data. © 2010 The Author.

Generally, the k values in the BiFeO3-H2O2-Vis system were accelerated by increasing BiFeO3 load and H2O2 concentration, but decreased with increasing initial pollutant concentration. To further enhance the degradation of pollutants at high concentrations, BiFeO3 was modified with the addition of surface modifiers. The addition of ethylenediamineteraacetic acid (EDTA, 0.4 mmol/L) increased the k value of MV degradation (60 micromol/L) from 1.01 x 10(-2) min(-1) in the BiFeO3-H2O2-Vis system to 1.30 min(-1) in the EDTA-BiFeO3-H2O2-Vis system by a factor of 128.

	abstract = {Background: Genomic data provide a wealth of new information for phylogenetic analysis. Yet making use of this data requires phylogenetic methods that can efficiently analyze extremely large data sets and account for processes of gene evolution, such as gene duplication and loss, incomplete lineage sorting (deep coalescence), or horizontal gene transfer, that cause incongruence among gene trees. One such approach is gene tree parsimony, which, given a set of gene trees, seeks a species tree that requires the smallest number of evolutionary events to explain the incongruence of the gene trees. However, the only existing algorithms for gene tree parsimony under the duplication-loss or deep coalescence reconciliation cost are prohibitively slow for large datasets.Results: We describe novel algorithms for SPR and TBR based local search heuristics under the duplication-loss cost, and we show how they can be adapted for the deep coalescence cost. These algorithms improve upon the best existing algorithms for these problems by a factor of n, where n is the number of species in the collection of gene trees. We implemented our new SPR based local search algorithm for the duplication-loss cost and demonstrate the tremendous improvement in runtime and scalability it provides compared to existing implementations. We also evaluate the performance of our algorithm on three large-scale genomic data sets.Conclusion: Our new algorithms enable, for the first time, gene tree parsimony analyses of thousands of genes from hundreds of taxa using the duplication-loss and deep coalescence reconciliation costs.

With the availability of genomic sequence data, there is increasing interest in using genes with a possible history of duplication and loss for species tree inference. Here we assess the performance of both nonprobabilistic and probabilistic species tree inference approaches using gene duplication and loss and coalescence simulations. We evaluated the performance of gene tree parsimony (GTP) based on duplication (Only-dup), duplication and loss (Dup-loss), and deep coalescence (Deep-c) costs, the NJ st distance method, the MulRF supertree method, and PHYLDOG, which jointly estimates gene trees and species tree using a hierarchical probabilistic model. We examined the effects of gene tree and species sampling, gene tree error, and duplication and loss rates on the accuracy of phylogenetic estimates. In the 10-taxon duplication and loss simulation experiments, MulRF is more accurate than the other methods when the duplication and loss rates are low, and Dup-loss is generally the most accurate when the duplication and loss rates are high. PHYLDOG performs well in 10-taxon duplication and loss simulations, but its run time is prohibitively long on larger data sets. In the larger duplication and loss simulation experiments, MulRF outperforms all other methods in experiments with at most 100 taxa; however, in the larger simulation, Dup-loss generally performs best. In all duplication and loss simulation experiments with more than 10 taxa, all methods perform better with more gene trees and fewer missing sequences, and they are all affected by gene tree error. Our results also highlight high levels of error in estimates of duplications and losses from GTP methods and demonstrate the usefulness of methods based on generic tree distances for large analyses.},

The general mixed Yule-coalescent (GMYC) was recently proposed as a potential means of increasing the rate of biodiversity exploration. We tested this method with simulated data and applied it to a group of poorly known bats (Hipposideros) from the Philippines. We then used echolocation call characteristics to evaluate the plausibility of species boundaries suggested by GMYC. In our simulations, GMYC performed relatively well (errors in estimated species diversity less than 25\%) when the product of the haploid effective population size (Ne) and speciation rate (SR; per lineage per million years) was less than or equal to 105, while interspecific variation in Ne was twofold or less. However, at higher but also biologically relevant values of Ne × SR and when Ne varied tenfold among species, performance was very poor. GMYC analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences from Philippine Hipposideros suggest actual diversity may be approximately twice the current estimate, and available echolocation call data are mostly consistent with GMYC delimitations. In conclusion, we consider the GMYC model useful under some conditions, but additional information on Ne, SR and/or corroboration from independent character data are needed to allow meaningful interpretation of results. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

Here, we confirm these results and provide the mathematical justifications. We point out that the distinction between population and species splits made in the protracted speciation model (PSM) has no influence on the generation of gene trees and sequence data, which explains why no method can use such data to distinguish between population splits and speciation. We suggest that the PSM is unrealistic as its mechanism for assigning species status assumes instantaneous speciation, contradicting prevailing taxonomic practice. We confirm the suggestion, based on simulation, that in the case of speciation with gene flow, Bayesian model selection as implemented in bpp tends to detect population splits when the amount of data (the number of loci) increases. We discuss the use of a recently proposed empirical genealogical divergence index (gdi) for species delimitation and illustrate that parameter estimates produced by a full likelihood analysis as implemented in bpp provide much more reliable inference under the gdi than the approximate method phrapl. We distinguish between Bayesian model selection and parameter estimation and suggest that the model selection approach is useful for identifying sympatric cryptic species, while the parameter estimation approach may be used to implement empirical criteria for determining species status among allopatric populations.},

	abstract = {The issue of species delimitation has long been confused with that of species conceptualization, leading to a half century of controversy concerning both the definition of the species category and methods for inferring the boundaries and numbers of species. Alternative species concepts agree in treating existence as a separately evolving metapopulation lineage as the primary defining property of the species category, but they disagree in adopting different properties acquired by lineages during the course of divergence (e.g., intrinsic reproductive isolation, diagnosability, monophyly) as secondary defining properties (secondary species criteria). A unified species concept can be achieved by treating existence as a separately evolving metapopulation lineage as the only necessary property of species and the former secondary species criteria as different lines of evidence (operational criteria) relevant to assessing lineage separation. This unified concept of species has several consequences for species delimitation, including the following: First, the issues of species conceptualization and species delimitation are clearly separated; the former secondary species criteria are no longer considered relevant to species conceptualization but only to species delimitation. Second, all of the properties formerly treated as secondary species criteria are relevant to species delimitation to the extent that they provide evidence of lineage separation. Third, the presence of any one of the properties (if appropriately interpreted) is evidence for the existence of a species, though more properties and thus more lines of evidence are associated with a higher degree of corroboration. Fourth, and perhaps most significantly, a unified species concept shifts emphasis away from the traditional species criteria, encouraging biologists to develop new methods of species delimitation that are not tied to those properties.},

In birds, molecular studies are producing evidence that species-level diversity is substantially underestimated. Many avian taxa comprise large complexes of subspecies that often represent species-level taxa by various criteria. One such group of Neotropical suboscine birds, the becards (Pachyramphus), ranges from Argentina through northern Mexico. Their taxonomic limits have been complex and controversial as the genus has bounced around a number of suboscine families. Additionally, the phylogenetic relationships within Pachyramphus are unresolved due to insufficient sampling of taxa and populations across species’ ranges. We used target capture of ultraconserved elements for 62 individuals representing 42 taxa, and sequenced two mitochondrial genes and two nuclear introns covering 265 individuals of 51 taxa, including all recognized species, resulting in the most densely and completely sampled phylogenetic hypothesis for Pachyramphus to date. We delimited species using a traditional taxonomic approach and then tested them under a Bayesian multi-species coalescent framework. In doing so, we provide evidence for multiple young, previously undetected evolutionary lineages within Pachyramphus. Deep, well-supported branches and a high number of intraspecific lineages across the tree suggest that at least 50\% of species diversity may be unrecognized.},

	abstract = {A genealogical species is defined as a basal group of organisms whose members are all more closely related to each other than they are to any organisms outside the group ("exclusivity"), and which contains no exclusive group within it. In practice, a pair of species is so defined when phylogenies of alleles from a sample of loci shows them to be reciprocally monophyletic at all or some specified fraction of the loci. We investigate the length of time it takes to attain this status when an ancestral population divides into two descendant populations of equal size with no gene exchange, and when genetic drift and mutation are the only evolutionary forces operating. The number of loci used has a substantial effect on the probability of observing reciprocal monophyly at different times after population separation, with very long times needed to observe complete reciprocal monophyly for a large number of loci. In contrast, the number of alleles sampled per locus has a relatively small effect on the probability of reciprocal monophyly. Because a single mitochondrial or chloroplast locus becomes reciprocally monophyletic much faster than does a single nuclear locus, it is not advisable to use mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA to recognize genealogical species for long periods after population divergence. Using a weaker criterion of assigning genealogical species status when more than 50\% of sampled nuclear loci show reciprocal monophyly, genealogical species status depends much less on the number of sampled loci, and is attained at roughly 4-7 N generations after populations are isolated, where N is the historically effective population size of each descendant. If genealogical species status is defined as more than 95\% of sampled nuclear loci showing reciprocal monophyly, this status is attained after roughly 9-12 N generations.},

	abstract = {Genetic data are frequently used to delimit species, where species status is determined on the basis of an exclusivity criterium, such as reciprocal monophyly. Not only are there numerous empirical examples of incongruence between the boundaries inferred from such data compared to other sources like morphology - especially with recently derived species, but population genetic theory also clearly shows that an inevitable bias in species status results because genetic thresholds do not explicitly take into account how the timing of speciation influences patterns of genetic differentiation. This study represents a fundamental shift in how genetic data might be used to delimit species. Rather than equating gene trees with a species tree or basing species status on some genetic threshold, the relationship between the gene trees and the species history is modeled probabilistically. Here we show that the same theory that is used to calculate the probability of reciprocal monophyly can also be used to delimit species despite widespread incomplete lineage sorting. The results from a preliminary simulation study suggest that very recently derived species can be accurately identified long before the requisite time for reciprocal monophyly to be achieved following speciation. The study also indicates the importance of sampling, both with regards to loci and individuals. Withstanding a thorough investigation into the conditions under which the coalescent-based approach will be effective, namely how the timing of divergence relative to the effective population size of species affects accurate species delimitation, the results are nevertheless consistent with other recent studies (aimed at inferring species relationships), showing that despite the lack of monophyletic gene trees, a signal of species divergence persists and can be extracted. Using an explicit model-based approach also avoids two primary problems with species delimitation that result when genetic thresholds are applied with genetic data - the inherent biases in species detection arising from when and how speciation occurred, and failure to take into account the high stochastic variance of genetic processes. Both the utility and sensitivities of the coalescent-based approach outlined here are discussed; most notably, a model-based approach is essential for determining whether incompletely sorted gene lineages are (or are not) consistent with separate species lineages, and such inferences require accurate model parameterization (i.e., a range of realistic effective population sizes relative to potential times of divergence for the purported species). It is the goal (and motivation of this study) that genetic data might be used effectively as a source of complementation to other sources of data for diagnosing species, as opposed to the exclusion of other evidence for species delimitation, which will require an explicit consideration of the effects of the temporal dynamic of lineage splitting on genetic data.},

We show that STRIDE correctly identifies the root of the species tree in multiple large-scale molecular phylogenetic data sets spanning a wide range of timescales and taxonomic groups. We demonstrate that the novel probability model implemented in STRIDE can accurately represent the ambiguity in species tree root assignment for data sets where information is limited. Furthermore, application of STRIDE to outgroup-free inference of the origin of the eukaryotic tree resulted in a root probability distribution that provides additional support for leading hypotheses for the origin of the eukaryotes.},

It may increase the risk of drug resistance, relapse, death, and prolonged infectiousness. The aim of this study was to determine factors predicting treatment adherence among smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients. METHODS AND FINDINGS A cohort of smear-positive tuberculosis patients diagnosed and registered in Hossana Hospital in southern Ethiopia from 1 September 2002 to 30 April 2004 were prospectively included. Using a structured questionnaire, potential predictor factors for defaulting from treatment were recorded at the beginning of treatment, and patients were followed up until the end of treatment. Default incidence rate was calculated and compared among preregistered risk factors. Of the 404 patients registered for treatment, 81 (20\%) defaulted from treatment. A total of 91\% (74 of 81) of treatment interruptions occurred during the continuation phase of treatment. On a Cox regression model, distance from home to treatment centre (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.97; p {\textless} 0.001), age {\textgreater} 25 y (HR = 1.71; p = 0.02), and necessity to use public transport to get to a treatment centre (HR = 1.59; p = 0.06) were found to be independently associated with defaulting from treatment. CONCLUSIONS Defaulting due to treatment noncompletion in this study setting is high, and the main determinants appear to be factors related to physical access to a treatment centre. The continuation phase of treatment is the most crucial time for treatment interruption, and future interventions should take this factor into consideration.},

Results: We introduce FAVITES, a robust framework for simulating realistic datasets for epidemics that are caused by fast-evolving pathogens like HIV. FAVITES creates a generative model that produces many items relevant to an epidemic, such as contact networks, transmission networks, phylogenetic trees, and error-prone sequence datasets. FAVITES is designed to be flexible and exhaustive by dividing the generative model into modules, each of which is expressed as a fixed API that can be implemented using various sub-models. We use FAVITES to simulate HIV datasets resembling the San Diego epidemic and show that the simulated datasets are realistic. We then use the simulated data to make inferences about the epidemic and how it is impact by increased treatment efforts. We also study two transmission network reconstruction methods and their effectiveness in detecting fast-growing clusters.},

	abstract = {Metagenomic profiling is challenging in part because of the highly uneven sampling of the tree of life by genome sequencing projects and the limitations imposed by performing phylogenetic inference at fixed taxonomic ranks. We present the algorithm MetaPalette, which uses long k -mer sizes ( k = 30, 50) to fit a k -mer “palette” of a given sample to the k -mer palette of reference organisms. By modeling the k -mer palettes of unknown organisms, the method also gives an indication of the presence, abundance, and evolutionary relatedness of novel organisms present in the sample. The method returns a traditional, fixed-rank taxonomic profile which is shown on independently simulated data to be one of the most accurate to date. Tree figures are also returned that quantify the relatedness of novel organisms to reference sequences, and the accuracy of such figures is demonstrated on simulated spike-ins and a metagenomic soil sample. The software implementing MetaPalette is available at: https://github.com/dkoslicki/MetaPalette . Pretrained databases are included for Archaea , Bacteria , Eukaryota , and viruses.},

	abstract = {Obtaining sequence data from historical museum specimens has been a growing research interest, invigorated by next-generation sequencing methods that allow inputs of highly degraded DNA. We applied a target enrichment and next-generation sequencing protocol to generate ultraconserved elements (UCEs) from 51 large carpenter bee specimens (genus Xylocopa), representing 25 species with specimen ages ranging from 2-121 years. We measured the correlation between specimen age and DNA yield (pre- and post-library preparation DNA concentration) and several UCE sequence capture statistics (raw read count, UCE reads on target, UCE mean contig length and UCE locus count) with linear regression models.We performed piecewise regression to test for specific breakpoints in the relationship of specimen age and DNA yield and sequence capture variables. Additionally, we compared UCE data from newer and older specimens of the same species and reconstructed their phylogeny in order to confirm the validity of our data. We recovered 6-972 UCE loci from samples with pre-library DNA concentrations ranging from 0.06-9.8 ng/μL. All investigated DNA yield and sequence capture variables were significantly but only moderately negatively correlated with specimen age. Specimens of age 20 years or less had significantly higher pre- and post-library concentrations, UCE contig lengths, and locus counts compared to specimens older than 20 years. We found breakpoints in our data indicating a decrease of the initial detrimental effect of specimen age on pre- and postlibrary DNA concentration and UCE contig length starting around 21-39 years after preservation. Our phylogenetic results confirmed the integrity of our data, giving preliminary insights into relationships within Xylocopa.We consider the effect of additional factors not measured in this study on our age-related sequence capture results, such as DNA fragmentation and preservation method, and discuss the promise of the UCE approach for largescale projects in insect phylogenomics using museum specimens.},

	abstract = {Next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS) have revolutionized biological research by significantly increasing data generation while simultaneously decreasing the time to data output. For many ecologists and evolutionary biologists, the research opportunities afforded by NGS are substantial; even for taxa lacking genomic resources, large-scale genome-level questions can now be addressed, opening up many new avenues of research. While rapid and massive sequencing afforded by NGS increases the scope and scale of many research objectives, whole genome sequencing is often unwarranted and unnecessarily complex for specific research questions. Recently developed targeted sequence enrichment, coupled with NGS, represents a beneficial strategy for enhancing data generation to answer questions in ecology and evolutionary biology. This marriage of technologies offers researchers a simple method to isolate and analyze a few to hundreds, or even thousands, of genes or genomic regions from few to many samples in a relatively efficient and effective manner. These strategies can be applied to questions at both the infra- and interspecific levels, including those involving parentage, gene fiow, divergence, phylogenetics, reticulate evolution, and many more. Here we provide a brief overview of targeted sequence enrichment, and emphasize the power of this technology to increase our ability to address a wide range of questions of interest to ecologists and evolutionary biologists, particularly for those working with taxa for which few genomic resources are available. © 2012 Botanical Society of America.},

	abstract = {With the decrease in cost and increase in output of whole-genome shotgun technologies, many metagenomic studies are utilizing this approach in lieu of the more traditional 16S rRNA amplicon technique. Due to the large number of relatively short reads output from whole-genome shotgun technologies, there is a need for fast and accurate short-read OTU classifiers. While there are relatively fast and accurate algorithms available, such as MetaPhlAn, MetaPhyler, PhyloPythiaS, and PhymmBL, these algorithms still classify samples in a read-by-read fashion and so execution times can range from hours to days on large datasets. We introduce WGSQuikr, a reconstruction method which can compute a vector of taxonomic assignments and their proportions in the sample with remarkable speed and accuracy. We demonstrate on simulated data that WGSQuikr is typically more accurate and up to an order of magnitude faster than the aforementioned classification algorithms. We also verify the utility of WGSQuikr on real biological data in the form of a mock community. WGSQuikr is a Whole-Genome Shotgun QUadratic, Iterative, [Formula: see text]-mer based Reconstruction method which extends the previously introduced 16S rRNA-based algorithm Quikr.

	abstract = {Gene trees are leaf-labeled trees inferred from molecular sequences. Because of gene duplication events arising in genomes, some species host several copies of the same gene, hence individual gene trees usually have several leaves labeled with identical species names. Dealing with such multi-labeled gene trees (MUL trees) is a substantial problem in phylogenomics, e.g. current supertree methods do not handle MUL trees, which restricts studies aimed at building the Tree of Life to a very small core of mono-copy genes. We propose to tackle this problem by mainly transforming a collection of MUL trees into a collection of trees, each containing single copies of labels. To achieve that aim, we provide several fast algorithmic building stones and describe how they fit in a general framework to build a species tree. First, we propose to separately preprocess each MUL tree in order to remove its redundant parts with respect to speciation events. For this purpose, we present a tree isomorphism algorithm for MUL trees to reduce redundant parts of these trees. Second, we show how the speciation signal contained in a MUL tree can be represented by a linear set of triplets. When this set is topologically coherent (compatible), we show that it can be used to produce a single-copy gene tree to replace the MUL tree while preserving the information it contains on speciation events. As an alternative approach, we propose to extract from each MUL tree a maximum size subtree that is free of duplication events. The algorithms are finally applied in a supertree analysis of hogenom, a database of homologous genes from fully sequenced genomes. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease (CD), are genetically linked to host pathways that implicate an underlying role for aberrant immune responses to intestinal microbiota. However, patterns of gut microbiome dysbiosis in IBD patients are inconsistent among published studies. Using samples from multiple gastrointestinal locations collected prior to treatment in new-onset cases, we studied the microbiome in the largest pediatric CD cohort to date. An axis defined by an increased abundance in bacteria which include Enterobacteriaceae, Pasteurellacaea, Veillonellaceae, and Fusobacteriaceae, and decreased abundance in Erysipelotrichales, Bacteroidales, and Clostridiales, correlates strongly with disease status. Microbiome comparison between CD patients with and without antibiotic exposure indicates that antibiotic use amplifies the microbial dysbiosis associated with CD. Comparing the microbial signatures between the ileum, the rectum, and fecal samples indicates that at this early stage of disease, assessing the rectal mucosal-associated microbiome offers unique potential for convenient and early diagnosis of CD. ©2014 Elsevier Inc.},

We explore the fundamental properties of insertion/deletion alleles (indels), an under-utilized form of genomic data with the potential to help solve this. We scored {\textgreater}5 million indels from {\textgreater}7000 pan-genomic intronic and ultraconserved element (UCE) loci in 48 representatives of all neoavian orders. We found that intronic and UCE indels exhibited less homoplasy than nucleotide (nt) data. Gene trees estimated using indel data were less resolved than those estimated using nt data. Nevertheless, Accurate Species TRee Algorithm (ASTRAL) species trees estimated using indels were generally similar to nt-based ASTRAL trees, albeit with lower support. However, the power of indel gene trees became clear when we combined them with nt gene trees, including a striking result for UCEs. The individual UCE indel and nt ASTRAL trees were incongruent with each other and with the intron ASTRAL trees; however, the combined indel+nt ASTRAL tree was much more congruent with the intronic trees. Finally, combining indel and nt data for both introns and UCEs provided sufficient power to reduce the scope of the polytomy that was previously proposed for several supraordinal lineages of Neoaves.},

Here, we report that inferring the time of most recent common ancestor of all these subtypes in a single phylogeny under a single (relaxed) molecular clock produces significantly different dates for many of the subtypes than does analysis of each subtype on its own. We explore various methods to ameliorate this problem. We conclude that current molecular dating methods are inadequate for dealing with this type of substitution rate variation in HIV-1.

Almost 40 years after the development of first substitution models, highly sophisticated, and data-specific substitution models continue emerging with the aim of better mimicking real evolutionary processes. Here I describe current trends in substitution models of DNA, codon and amino acid sequence evolution, including advantages and pitfalls of the most popular models. The perspective concludes that despite the large number of currently available substitution models, further research is required for more realistic modeling, especially for DNA coding and amino acid data. Additionally, the development of more accurate complex models should be coupled with new implementations and improvements of methods and frameworks for substitution model selection and downstream evolutionary analysis.},

Molecular clock dating analyses of coronaviruses suggest that the most recent common ancestor of these viruses existed around 10,000 years ago. This relatively young age is in sharp contrast to the ancient evolutionary history of their putative natural hosts, which began diversifying tens of millions of years ago. Here, we attempted to resolve this discrepancy by applying more realistic evolutionary models that have previously revealed the ancient evolutionary history of other RNA viruses. By explicitly modeling variation in the strength of natural selection over time and thereby improving the modeling of substitution saturation, we found that the time to the most recent ancestor common for all coronaviruses is likely far greater (millions of years) than the previously inferred range. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.},

	abstract = {Bacteria exploit an arsenal of antimicrobial peptides and proteins to compete with each other. Three main competition systems have been described: type six secretion systems (T6SS); contact dependent inhibition (CDI); and bacteriocins. Unlike T6SS and CDI systems, bacteriocins do not require contact between bacteria but are diffusible toxins released into the environment. Identified almost a century ago, our understanding of bacteriocin distribution and prevalence in bacterial populations remains poor. In the case of protein bacteriocins, this is because of high levels of sequence diversity and difficulties in distinguishing their killing domains from those of other competition systems. Here, we develop a robust bioinformatics pipeline exploiting Hidden Markov Models for the identification of nuclease bacteriocins (NBs) in bacteria of which, to-date, only a handful are known. NBs are large ({\textgreater}60 kDa) toxins that target nucleic acids (DNA, tRNA or rRNA) in the cytoplasm of susceptible bacteria, usually closely related to the producing organism. We identified {\textgreater}3000 NB genes located on plasmids or on the chromosome from 53 bacterial species distributed across different ecological niches, including human, animals, plants, and the environment. A newly identified NB predicted to be specific for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (pyocin Sn) was produced and shown to kill P. aeruginosa thereby validating our pipeline. Intriguingly, while the genes encoding the machinery needed for NB translocation across the cell envelope are widespread in Gram-negative bacteria, NBs are found exclusively in γ-proteobacteria. Similarity network analysis demonstrated that NBs fall into eight groups each with a distinct arrangement of protein domains involved in import. The only structural feature conserved across all groups was a sequence motif critical for cell-killing that is generally not found in bacteriocins targeting the periplasm, implying a specific role in translocating the nuclease to the cytoplasm. Finally, we demonstrate a significant association between nuclease colicins, NBs specific for Escherichia coli, and virulence factors, suggesting NBs play a role in infection processes, most likely by enabling pathogens to outcompete commensal bacteria.},

	abstract = {Genomic datasets sometimes support unconventional or conflicting phylogenetic relationships when different tree-building methods are applied. Coherent interpretations of such results are enabled by partitioning support for controversial relationships among the constituent genes of a phylogenomic dataset. For the supermatrix (= concatenation) approach, several simple methods that measure the distribution of support and conflict among loci were introduced over 15 years ago. More recently, partitioned coalescence support (PCS) was developed for phylogenetic coalescence methods that account for incomplete lineage sorting and use the summed fits of gene trees to estimate the species tree. Here, we automate computation of PCS to permit application of this index to genome-scale matrices that include hundreds of loci. Reanalyses of four phylogenomic datasets for amniotes, land plants, skinks, and angiosperms demonstrate how PCS scores can be used to: 1) compare conflicting results favored by alternative coalescence methods, 2) identify outlier gene trees that have a disproportionate influence on the resolution of contentious relationships, 3) assess the effects of missing data in species-trees analysis, and 4) clarify biases in commonly-implemented coalescence methods and support indices. We show that key phylogenomic conclusions from these analyses often hinge on just a few gene trees and that results can be driven by specific biases of a particular coalescence method and/or the extreme weight placed on gene trees with high taxon sampling. Attributing exceptionally high weight to some gene trees and very low weight to other gene trees counters the basic logic of phylogenomic coalescence analysis; even clades in species trees with high support according to commonly used indices (likelihood-ratio test, bootstrap, Bayesian local posterior probability) can be unstable to the removal of only one or two gene trees with high PCS. Computer simulations cannot adequately describe all of the contingencies and complexities of empirical genetic data. PCS scores complement simulation work by providing specific insights into a particular dataset given the assumptions of the phylogenetic coalescence method that is applied. In combination with standard measures of nodal support, PCS provides a more complete understanding of the overall genomic evidence for contested evolutionary relationships in species trees.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Likelihood-based phylogenetic inference is generally considered to be the most reliable classification method for unknown sequences. However, traditional likelihood-based phylogenetic methods cannot be applied to large volumes of short reads from next-generation sequencing due to computational complexity issues and lack of phylogenetic signal. "Phylogenetic placement," where a reference tree is fixed and the unknown query sequences are placed onto the tree via a reference alignment, is a way to bring the inferential power offered by likelihood-based approaches to large data sets. RESULTS This paper introduces pplacer, a software package for phylogenetic placement and subsequent visualization. The algorithm can place twenty thousand short reads on a reference tree of one thousand taxa per hour per processor, has essentially linear time and memory complexity in the number of reference taxa, and is easy to run in parallel. Pplacer features calculation of the posterior probability of a placement on an edge, which is a statistically rigorous way of quantifying uncertainty on an edge-by-edge basis. It also can inform the user of the positional uncertainty for query sequences by calculating expected distance between placement locations, which is crucial in the estimation of uncertainty with a well-sampled reference tree. The software provides visualizations using branch thickness and color to represent number of placements and their uncertainty. A simulation study using reads generated from 631 COG alignments shows a high level of accuracy for phylogenetic placement over a wide range of alignment diversity, and the power of edge uncertainty estimates to measure placement confidence. CONCLUSIONS Pplacer enables efficient phylogenetic placement and subsequent visualization, making likelihood-based phylogenetics methodology practical for large collections of reads; it is freely available as source code, binaries, and a web service.},

The main purpose of the present paper is to introduce such an algorithm. In applications, computing Frechet means is probably most needed in the tree space, which is an instance of Hadamard spaces, invented by Billera, Holmes, and Vogtmann (2001) as a tool for averaging phylogenetic trees. It turns out, however, that it can also be used to model numerous other tree-like structures. Since there now exists a polynomial-time algorithm for computing geodesics in the tree space due to Owen and Provan (2011), we obtain an efficient algorithm for computing Frechet means, which can be directly used in practice.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, phylogeny and sequence alignment are estimated separately: first estimate a multiple sequence alignment and then infer a phylogeny based on the sequence alignment estimated in the previous step. However, uncertainty in the alignment estimation is ignored, resulting, possibly, in overstated certainty in phylogeny estimates. We develop a joint model for co-estimating phylogeny and sequence alignment which improves estimates from the traditional approach by accounting for uncertainty in the alignment in phylogenetic inferences. Our insertion and deletion (indel) model allows arbitrary-length overlapping indel events and a general distribution for indel fragment size. We employ a Bayesian approach using MCMC to estimate the joint posterior distribution of a phylogenetic tree and a multiple sequence alignment. Our approach has a tree and a complete history of indel events mapped onto the tree as the state space of the Markov Chain while alternative previous approaches have a tree and an alignment. A large state space containing a complete history of indel events makes our MCMC approach more challenging, but it enables us to infer more information about the indel process. The performances of this joint method and traditional sequential methods are compared using simulated data as well as real data.

Phylogenetic consensus methods, in particular, are known to suffer from this problem. In this paper we provide a novel framework in which to define and identify rogue taxa. In this framework, we formulate a bicriterion optimization problem that models the net increase in useful information present in the consensus tree when certain taxa are removed from the input data. We also provide an effective greedy heuristic to identify a subset of rogue taxa and use it in a series of experiments, using both pathological examples described in the literature and a collection of large biological datasets. As the presence of rogue taxa in a set of bootstrap replicates can lead to deceivingly poor support values, we propose a procedure to recompute support values in light of the rogue taxa identified by our algorithm; applying this procedure to our biological datasets caused a large number of edges to change from ``unsupported" to ``supported" status, indicating that many existing phylogenies should be recomputed and reevaluated to reduce any inaccuracies introduced by rogue taxa.},

Therefore, alignment-free approaches have become popular in recent years. One of the best known alignment-free methods is the average common substring approach that defines a distance measure on sequences based on the average length of longest common words between them. Herein, we generalize this approach by considering longest common substrings with k mismatches. We present a greedy heuristic to approximate the length of such k-mismatch substrings, and we describe kmacs, an efficient implementation of this idea based on generalized enhanced suffix arrays. RESULTS To evaluate the performance of our approach, we applied it to phylogeny reconstruction using a large number of DNA and protein sequence sets. In most cases, phylogenetic trees calculated with kmacs were more accurate than trees produced with established alignment-free methods that are based on exact word matches. Especially on protein sequences, our method seems to be superior. On simulated protein families, kmacs even outperformed a classical approach to phylogeny reconstruction using multiple alignment and maximum likelihood.

	abstract = {Neisseria meningitidis is a leading cause of infectious childhood mortality worldwide. Most research efforts have hitherto focused on disease isolates belonging to only a few hypervirulent clonal lineages. However, up to 10\% of the healthy human population is temporarily colonized by genetically diverse strains mostly with little or no pathogenic potential. Currently, little is known about the biology of carriage strains and their evolutionary relationship with disease isolates. The expression of a polysaccharide capsule is the only trait that has been convincingly linked to the pathogenic potential of N. meningitidis. To gain insight into the evolution of virulence traits in this species, whole-genome sequences of three meningococcal carriage isolates were obtained. Gene content comparisons with the available genome sequences from three disease isolates indicate that there is no core pathogenome in N. meningitidis. A comparison of the chromosome structure suggests that a filamentous prophage has mediated large chromosomal rearrangements and the translocation of some candidate virulence genes. Interspecific comparison of the available Neisseria genome sequences and dot blot hybridizations further indicate that the insertion sequence IS1655 is restricted only to N. meningitidis; its low sequence diversity is an indicator of an evolutionarily recent population bottleneck. A genome-based phylogenetic reconstruction provides evidence that N. meningitidis has emerged as an unencapsulated human commensal from a common ancestor with Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria lactamica and consecutively acquired the genes responsible for capsule synthesis via horizontal gene transfer.},

Loss or gain of one or more nucleotide repeats through a recombination-independent slippage mechanism is known to mediate phase variation of surface molecules of pathogenic bacteria, including H. influenzae. This facilitates evasion of host defenses and adaptation to the varying microenvironments of the host. We reasoned that iterative nucleotides could identify novel genes relevant to microbe-host interactions. Our search of the Rd genome sequence identified 9 novel loci with multiple (range 6-36, mean 22) tandem tetranucleotide repeats. All were found to be located within putative open reading frames and included homologues of hemoglobin-binding proteins of Neisseria, a glycosyltransferase (lgtC gene product) of Neisseria, and an adhesin of Yersinia. These tetranucleotide repeat sequences were also shown to be present in two other epidemiologically different H. influenzae type b strains, although the number and distribution of repeats was different. Further characterization of the lgtC gene showed that it was involved in phenotypic switching of a lipopolysaccharide epitope and that this variable expression was associated with changes in the number of tetranucleotide repeats. Mutation of lgtC resulted in attenuated virulence of H. influenzae in an infant rat model of invasive infection. These data indicate the rapidity, economy, and completeness with which whole genome sequences can be used to investigate the biology of pathogenic bacteria.},

A variety of theoretical foundations are being used to derive alignment-free methods that overcome this limitation. The formulation of alternative metrics for dissimilarity between sequences and their algorithmic implementations are reviewed. RESULTS The overwhelming majority of work on alignment-free sequence has taken place in the past two decades, with most reports published in the past 5 years. Two main categories of methods have been proposed-methods based on word (oligomer) frequency, and methods that do not require resolving the sequence with fixed word length segments. The first category is based on the statistics of word frequency, on the distances defined in a Cartesian space defined by the frequency vectors, and on the information content of frequency distribution. The second category includes the use of Kolmogorov complexity and Chaos Theory. Despite their low visibility, alignment-free metrics are in fact already widely used as pre-selection filters for alignment-based querying of large applications. Recent work is furthering their usage as a scale-independent methodology that is capable of recognizing homology when loss of contiguity is beyond the possibility of alignment.

Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes and their comparative analysis, complete descriptions of interactomes and their comparative analysis is fundamental to a deeper understanding of biological processes. A first step in such an analysis is to align two or more PPI networks. Here, we introduce an algorithm, IsoRank, for global alignment of multiple PPI networks. The guiding intuition here is that a protein in one PPI network is a good match for a protein in another network if their respective sequences and neighborhood topologies are a good match. We encode this intuition as an eigenvalue problem in a manner analogous to Google's PageRank method. Using IsoRank, we compute a global alignment of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus musculus, and Homo sapiens PPI networks. We demonstrate that incorporating PPI data in ortholog prediction results in improvements over existing sequence-only approaches and over predictions from local alignments of the yeast and fly networks. Previous methods have been effective at identifying conserved, localized network patterns across pairs of networks. This work takes the further step of performing a global alignment of multiple PPI networks. It simultaneously uses sequence similarity and network data and, unlike previous approaches, explicitly models the tradeoff inherent in combining them. We expect IsoRank-with its simultaneous handling of node similarity and network similarity-to be applicable across many scientific domains.},

The properties of the method have been proven both analytically and by computer simulations. Like all other methods, paralinear distances can fail when sequences are misaligned or when site-to-site sequence variation of rates is extensive. To examine the usefulness of paralinear distances, the "origin of the eukaryotes" has been investigated by the analysis of elongation factor Tu sequences with a variety of sequence alignments. It has been found that the order in which sequences are pairwise aligned strongly determines the topology which is reconstructed by paralinear distances (as it does for all other reconstruction methods tested). When the parts of the alignment that are unaffected by alignment order are analyzed, paralinear distances strongly select the eocyte topology. This provides evidence that the eocyte prokaryotes are the closest prokaryotic relatives of the eukaryotes.},

The existing phylogenomic methods all use assembled sequences, which are often not available owing to the difficulty of assembling short-reads; this obstructs phylogenetic investigations on species without a reference genome. In this report, we present co-phylog, an assembly-free phylogenomic approach that creates a 'micro-alignment' at each 'object' in the sequence using the 'context' of the object and calculates pairwise distances before reconstructing the phylogenetic tree based on those distances. We explored the parameters' usages and the optimal working range of co-phylog, assessed co-phylog using the simulated next-generation sequencing (NGS) data and the real NGS raw data. We also compared co-phylog method with traditional alignment and alignment-free methods and illustrated the advantages and limitations of co-phylog method. In conclusion, we demonstrated that co-phylog is efficient algorithm and that it delivers high resolution and accurate phylogenies using whole-genome unassembled sequencing data, especially in the case of closely related organisms, thereby significantly alleviating the computational burden in the genomic era.},

	abstract = {A series of new results useful to the study of DNA sequences using Markov models of substitution are presented with proofs. General time-reversible distances can be extended to accommodate any fixed distribution of rates across sites by replacing the logarithmic function of a matrix with the inverse of a moment generating function. Estimators are presented assuming a gamma distribution, the inverse Gaussian distribution, or a mixture of either of these with invariant sites. Also considered are the different ways invariant sites may be removed and how these differences may affect estimated distances. Through collaboration, we implemented these distances into PAUP in 1994. The variance of these new distances is approximated via the delta method. It is also shown how to predict the divergence expected for a pair of sequences given a rate matrix and a distribution of rates across sites, allowing iterated ML estimates of distances under any reversible model. A simple test of whether a rate matrix is time reversible is also presented. These new methods are used to estimate the divergence time of humans and chimps from mtDNA sequence data. These analyses support suggestions that the human lineage has an enhanced transition rate relative to other hominoids. These studies also show that transversion distances differ substantially from the overall distances which are dominated by transitions. Transversions alone apparently suggest a very recent divergence time for humans versus chimps and/or a very old ({\textgreater} 16 myr) divergence time for humans versus orangutans. This work illustrates graphically ways to interpret the reliability of distance-based transformations, using the corrected transition to transversion ratio returned for pairs of sequences which are successively more diverged.},

	abstract = {It is well known that basing phylogenetic reconstructions on uncorrected genetic distances can lead to errors in their reconstruction. Nevertheless, it is often common practice to report simply the most similar BLAST (Altschul et al. 1997) hit in genomic reports that discuss many genes (Ruepp et al. 2000; Freiberg et al. 1997). This is because BLAST hits can provide a rapid, efficient, and concise analysis of many genes at once. These hits are often interpreted to imply that the gene is most closely related to the gene or protein in the databases that returned the closest BLAST hit. Though these two may coincide, for many genes, particularly genes with few homologs, they may not be the same. There are a number of circumstances that can account for such limitations in accuracy (Eisen 2000). We stress here that genes appearing to be the most similar based on BLAST hits are often not each others closest relative phylogenetically. The extent to which this occurs depends on the availability of close relatives present in the databases. As an example we have chosen the analysis of the genomes of a crenarcheaota species Aeropyrum pernix, an organism with few close relatives fully sequenced, and Escherichia coli, an organism whose closest relative, Salmonella typhimurium, is completely sequenced.},

Answering this question requires robust measurement of whole-genome relatedness among thousands of genomes and from diverge phylogenetic lineages. Whole-genome similarity metrics such as Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) can provide the resolution needed for this task, overcoming several limitations of traditional techniques used for the same purposes. Although the number of genomes currently available may be adequate, the associated bioinformatics tools for analysis are lagging behind these developments and cannot scale to large datasets. Here, we present a new method, FastANI, to compute ANI using alignment-free approximate sequence mapping. Our analyses demonstrate that FastANI produces an accurate ANI estimate and is up to three orders of magnitude faster when compared to an alignment (e.g., BLAST)-based approach. We leverage FastANI to compute pairwise ANI values among all prokaryotic genomes available in the NCBI database. Our results reveal a clear genetic discontinuity among the database genomes, with 99.8\% of the total 8 billion genome pairs analyzed showing either {\textgreater}95\% intra-species ANI or {\textless}83\% inter-species ANI values. We further show that this discontinuity is recovered with or without the most frequently represented species in the database and is robust to historic additions in the public genome databases. Therefore, 95\% ANI represents an accurate threshold for demarcating almost all currently named prokaryotic species, and wide species boundaries may exist for prokaryotes.},

Because the two-step process is conditioned on an RNA and its mutant ensemble, we no longer have a global substitution matrix, nor do we explicitly assume any for this inhomogeneous stochastic process. After introducing the base model of RNA evolution, we outline the heuristic implementation algorithm and several model improvements.

The accuracy of the algorithm is evaluated on several real-world data sets and compared with placement by pair-wise sequence comparison, using edit distances and BLAST. We introduce a slow and accurate as well as a fast and less accurate placement algorithm. For the slow algorithm, we develop additional heuristic techniques that yield almost the same run times as the fast version with only a small loss of accuracy. When those additional heuristics are employed, the run time of the more accurate algorithm is comparable with that of a simple BLAST search for data sets with a high number of short query sequences. Moreover, the accuracy of the EPA is significantly higher, in particular when the sample of taxa in the reference topology is sparse or inadequate. Our algorithm, which has been integrated into RAxML, therefore provides an equally fast but more accurate alternative to BLAST for tree-based inference of the evolutionary origin and composition of short sequence reads. We are also actively developing a Web server that offers a freely available service for computing read placements on trees using the EPA.},

The main reason for this is practical: BLAST's programs are about 100-fold faster than the fastest competing implementations of probabilistic inference methods. I describe recent work on the HMMER software suite for protein sequence analysis, which implements probabilistic inference using profile hidden Markov models. Our aim in HMMER3 is to achieve BLAST's speed while further improving the power of probabilistic inference based methods. HMMER3 implements a new probabilistic model of local sequence alignment and a new heuristic acceleration algorithm. Combined with efficient vector-parallel implementations on modern processors, these improvements synergize. HMMER3 uses more powerful log-odds likelihood scores (scores summed over alignment uncertainty, rather than scoring a single optimal alignment); it calculates accurate expectation values (E-values) for those scores without simulation using a generalization of Karlin/Altschul theory; it computes posterior distributions over the ensemble of possible alignments and returns posterior probabilities (confidences) in each aligned residue; and it does all this at an overall speed comparable to BLAST. The HMMER project aims to usher in a new generation of more powerful homology search tools based on probabilistic inference methods.},

Two well studied approaches to cope with this challenge are to solve either biologically informed gene tree parsimony (GTP) problems under gene duplication, gene loss, and deep coalescence, or the classic RF supertree problem that does not rely on any biological model. Despite the potential of these problems to infer credible species trees, they are NP-hard. Therefore, these problems are addressed by heuristics that typically lack any provable accuracy and precision. We describe fast dynamic programming algorithms that solve the GTP problems and the RF supertree problem exactly, and demonstrate that our algorithms can solve instances with data sets consisting of as many as 22 taxa. Extensions of our algorithms can also report the number of all optimal species trees, as well as the trees themselves. To better asses the quality of the resulting species trees that best fit the given gene trees, we also compute the worst case species trees, their numbers, and optimization score for each of the computational problems. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our exact algorithms using empirical and simulated data sets, and analyze the quality of heuristic solutions for the studied problems by contrasting them with our exact solutions. © Imperial College Press.},

Here we introduce the Optimal Tree Completion Problem, a general optimization problem that involves completing an unrooted binary tree (i.e., adding missing leaves) so as to minimize its distance from a reference tree on a superset of the leaves. More formally, given a pair of unrooted binary trees (T, t) where T has leaf set S and t has leaf set R⊆S, we wish to add all the leaves from S {\textbackslash} R to t so as to produce a new tree t0 on leaf set S that has the minimum distance to T. We show that when the distance is defined by the Robinson-Foulds (RF) distance, an optimal solution can be found in polynomial time. We also present OCTAL, an algorithm that solves this RF Optimal Tree Completion Problem exactly in O({\textbar}S{\textbar} 2 ) time. We report on a simulation study where we complete estimated gene trees using a reference tree that is based on a species tree estimated from a multi-locus dataset. OCTAL produces completed gene trees that are closer to the true gene trees than an existing heuristic approach, but the accuracy of the completed gene trees computed by OCTAL depends on how topologically similar the estimated species tree is to the true gene tree. Hence, under conditions with relatively low gene tree heterogeneity, OCTAL can be used to provide highly accurate completions of estimated gene trees. We close with a discussion of future research.},

	abstract = {For a combination of reasons (including data generation protocols, approaches to taxon and gene sampling, and gene birth and loss), estimated gene trees are often incomplete, meaning that they do not contain all of the species of interest. As incomplete gene trees can impact downstream analyses, accurate completion of gene trees is desirable. We introduce the Optimal Tree Completion problem, a general optimization problem that involves completing an unrooted binary tree (i.e., adding missing leaves) so as to minimize its distance from a reference tree on a superset of the leaves. We present OCTAL, an algorithm that finds an optimal solution to this problem when the distance between trees is defined using the Robinson–Foulds (RF) distance, and we prove that OCTAL runs in \$\$O(n{\textasciicircum}2)\$\$ O ( n 2 ) time, where n is the total number of species. We report on a simulation study in which gene trees can differ from the species tree due to incomplete lineage sorting, and estimated gene trees are completed using OCTAL with a reference tree based on a species tree estimated from the multi-locus dataset. OCTAL produces completed gene trees that are closer to the true gene trees than an existing heuristic approach in ASTRAL-II, but the accuracy of a completed gene tree computed by OCTAL depends on how topologically similar the reference tree (typically an estimated species tree) is to the true gene tree. OCTAL is a useful technique for adding missing taxa to incomplete gene trees and provides good accuracy under a wide range of model conditions. However, results show that OCTAL’s accuracy can be reduced when incomplete lineage sorting is high, as the reference tree can be far from the true gene tree. Hence, this study suggests that OCTAL would benefit from using other types of reference trees instead of species trees when there are large topological distances between true gene trees and species trees.},

After identifying competing hypotheses, we performed maximum likelihood searches for trees conforming to each hypothesis. Kishino-Hasegawa tests were used to determine whether the data (LSU, SSU, and combined) reject any of the competing hypotheses. We also conducted unconstrained tree searches, compared the resulting topologies, and calculated bootstrap indices. Shimodaira-Hasegawa tests were applied to determine whether the data reject any of the topologies resulting from the constrained and unconstrained tree searches. LSU, SSU, and the combined data strongly contradict two assertions pertaining to sponge phylogeny. Hexactinellid sponges are not likely to be the basal lineage of a monophyletic Porifera or the sister group to all other animals. Instead, Hexactinellida and Demospongia form a well-supported clade of siliceous sponges, Silicea. It remains unclear, on the basis of these data alone, whether the calcarean sponges are more closely related to Silicea or to nonsponge animals. The SSU and combined data reject the hypothesis that Bilateria is more closely related to Ctenophora than it is to Cnidaria, whereas LSU data alone do not refute either hypothesis. LSU and SSU data agree in supporting the monophyly of Bilateria, Cnidaria, Ctenophora, and Metazoa. LSU sequence data reveal phylogenetic structure in a data set with limited taxon sampling. Continued accumulation of LSU sequences should increase our understanding of animal phylogeny.},

Distinguishing among these trees also was little affected by the use of different substitution parameters. The 13-locus combined data set was partitioned into nine classes based on substitution rates. Sites evolving at intermediate rates had the best likelihood and parsimony scores on gnepine trees, and those evolving at the fastest rates had the best parsimony scores on Gnetales-sister trees (Gnetales plus other seed plants). When the fastest evolving sites were excluded from parsimony analyses, well-supported gnepine trees were inferred from the combined data and from each genomic partition. When all sites were included, Gnetales-sister trees were inferred from the combined data, whereas a different tree was inferred from each genomic partition. Maximum likelihood trees from the combined data and from each genomic partition were well-supported gnepine trees.

Summary methods, which estimate species trees by combining gene trees, are popular but their accuracy is impaired by gene tree estimation error. Other approaches have been developed that only use the site patterns to estimate the species tree, and so are not impacted by gene tree estimation issues. In particular, PAUP ∗ provides a method in which SVDquartets is used to compute a set Q of quartet trees (i.e., trees on four leaves), and then a heuristic search is used to combine the quartet trees into a species tree T, seeking to maximize the number of quartet trees in Q that agree with T. The PAUP ∗ method based on SVDquartets (henceforth referred to as SVDquartets + PAUP ∗ ) is increasingly used in phylogenomic studies due to its ability to reconstruct species trees without needing to estimate accurate gene trees. We present SVDquest ∗ , a new method for constructing species trees using site patterns that is guaranteed to produce species trees that satisfy at least as many quartet trees as SVDquartets + PAUP ∗ . We show that SVDquest ∗ is competitive with ASTRAL and ASTRID (two leading summary methods) in terms of topological accuracy, and tends to be more accurate than ASTRAL and ASTRID under conditions with relatively high gene tree estimation error.

Motivation: The estimation of species phylogenies requires multiple loci, since different loci can have different trees due to incomplete lineage sorting, modeled by the multi-species coalescent model. We recently developed a coalescent-based method, ASTRAL, which is statistically consistent under the multi-species coalescent model and which is more accurate than other coalescent-based methods on the datasets we examined. ASTRAL runs in polynomial time, by constraining the search space using a set of allowed 'bipartitions'. Despite the limitation to allowed bipartitions, ASTRAL is statistically consistent. Results: We present a new version of ASTRAL, which we call ASTRAL-II. We show that ASTRAL-II has substantial advantages over ASTRAL: it is faster, can analyze much larger datasets (up to 1000 species and 1000 genes) and has substantially better accuracy under some conditions. ASTRAL's running time is O(n2k{\textbar}X{\textbar}2), and ASTRAL-II's running time is O(nk{\textbar}X{\textbar}2), where n is the number of species, k is the number of loci and X is the set of allowed bipartitions for the search space.},

	abstract = {Background Sexually transmitted infections spread across contact networks. Partner elicitation and notification are commonly used public health tools to identify, notify, and offer testing to persons linked in these contact networks. For HIV-1, a rapidly evolving pathogen with low per-contact transmission rates, viral genetic sequences are an additional source of data that can be used to infer or refine transmission networks. Methods and Findings The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene interviews individuals newly diagnosed with HIV and elicits names of sexual and injection drug using partners. By law, the Department of Health also receives HIV sequences when these individuals enter healthcare and their physicians order resistance testing. Our study used both HIV sequence and partner naming data from 1342 HIV-infected persons in New York City between 2006 and 2012 to infer and compare sexual/drug-use named partner and genetic transmission networks. Using these networks, we determined a range of genetic distance thresholds suitable for identifying potential transmission partners. In 48\% of cases, named partners were infected with genetically closely related viruses, compatible with but not necessarily representing or implying, direct transmission. Partner pairs linked through the genetic similarity of their HIV sequences were also linked by naming in 53\% of cases. Persons who reported high-risk heterosexual contact were more likely to name at least one partner with a genetically similar virus than those reporting their risk as injection drug use or men who have sex with men. Conclusions We analyzed an unprecedentedly large and detailed partner tracing and HIV sequence dataset and determined an empirically justified range of genetic distance thresholds for identifying potential transmission partners. We conclude that genetic linkage provides more reliable evidence for identifying potential transmission partners than partner naming, highlighting the importance and complementarity of both epidemiological and molecular genetic surveillance for characterizing regional HIV-1 epidemics.},

Phylogenetic data gives us a new insight into these processes, providing a more informative perspective on functional and trait diversity than taxonomic richness alone. But the sheer scale of high resolution phylogenetic data also presents a new challenge to ecological theory. We bring a sampling theory perspective to microbial communities, considering a local community of co-occuring organisms as a sample from a larger regional pool, and apply our framework to make analytical predictions for local phylogenetic diversity arising from a given metacommunity and community assembly process. We characterize community assembly in terms of quantitative descriptions of clustered, random and overdispersed sampling, which have been associated with hypotheses of environmental filtering and competition. Using our approach, we analyze large microbial communities from the human microbiome, uncovering significant variation in diversity across habitats relative to the null hypothesis of random sampling.},

However, one of the first steps--to classify the operational taxonomic units within the sample--can be a computationally time-consuming task because most methods rely on computing the taxonomic assignment of each individual read out of tens to hundreds of thousands of reads. RESULTS: We introduce Quikr: a QUadratic, K-mer-based, Iterative, Reconstruction method, which computes a vector of taxonomic assignments and their proportions in the sample using an optimization technique motivated from the mathematical theory of compressive sensing. On both simulated and actual biological data, we demonstrate that Quikr typically has less error and is typically orders of magnitude faster than the most commonly used taxonomic assignment technique (the Ribosomal Database Project's Naïve Bayesian Classifier). Furthermore, the technique is shown to be unaffected by the presence of chimeras, thereby allowing for the circumvention of the time-intensive step of chimera filtering.

The last decade has seen a large number of new methods developed to estimate species trees from multi-locus datasets, specifically addressing this cause of gene tree heterogeneity. In this paper, we review these methods, focusing mainly on issues that relate to analyses of datasets containing large numbers of species or loci (or both).

Supertree estimation is itself NP-hard, and no current supertree method has sufficient accuracy and scalability to provide good accuracy on the large datasets that supertree methods were designed for, containing thousands of species and many subset trees. RESULTS We present FastRFS, a new method based on a dynamic programming method we have developed to find an exact solution to the Robinson-Foulds Supertree problem within a constrained search space. FastRFS has excellent accuracy in terms of criterion scores and topological accuracy of the resultant trees, substantially improving on competing methods on a large collection of biological and simulated data. In addition, FastRFS is extremely fast, finishing in minutes on even very large datasets, and in under an hour on a biological dataset with 2228 species.

A key tool in analyses of large data sets has been the construction of separate trees for subsets (e.g., quartets) of sequences, and subsequent combination of these subtrees into a single tree for the full set (i.e., supertree analysis). Unfortunately, even amalgamating quartets into a supertree remains a computationally daunting task. Assigning weights to quartets to indicate importance or reliability was proposed more than a decade ago, but handling weighted quartets is even more challenging and has scarcely been attempted in the past. In this work, we focus on weighted quartet-based approaches. We propose a scheme to assign weights to quartets coming from weighted trees and devise a tree similarity measure for weighted trees based on weighted quartets. We also extend the quartet MaxCut (QMC algorithm) to handle weighted quartets. We evaluate these tools on simulated and real data. Our simulated data analysis highlights the additional information that is conveyed when using the new weighted tree similarity measure, and shows that extending QMC to a weighted setting improves the quality of tree reconstruction. Our analyses of a cyanobacterial data set with weighted QMC reinforce previous results achieved with other tools.},

In this note, we demonstrate formally that a basic statistical problem arises if one tries to avoid accounting for these two processes and analyses the genetic data directly via a concatenation approach. More precisely, we show that, under the multispecies coalescent with a standard site substitution model, maximum likelihood estimation on sequence data that has been concatenated across genes and performed under the incorrect assumption that all sites have evolved independently and identically on a fixed tree is a statistically inconsistent estimator of the species tree. Our results provide a formal justification of simulation results described of Kubatko and Degnan (2007) and others, and complements recent theoretical results by DeGIorgio and Degnan (2010) and Chifman and Kubtako (2014).},

	abstract = {Targeted sequence capture is becoming a widespread tool for generating large phylogenomic datasets to address difficult phylogenetic problems. However, this methodology often generates datasets in which increasing the number of taxa and loci increases amounts of missing data. Thus, a fundamental (but still unresolved) question is whether sampling should be designed to maximize sampling of taxa or genes, or to minimize the inclusion of missing data cells. Here, we explore this question for an ancient, rapid radiation of lizards, the pleurodont iguanians. Pleurodonts include many well-known clades (e.g. anoles, basilisks, iguanas, spiny lizards) but relationships among families have proven difficult to resolve strongly and consistently using traditional sequencing approaches. We generated up to 4,921 ultraconserved elements with sampling strategies including 16, 29, and 44 taxa, from 1,179 to {\textasciitilde}2.4 million characters per matrix and {\textasciitilde}30\% to 60\% total missing data. We then compared mean branch support for interfamilial relationships under these 15 different sampling strategies for both concatenated (maximum likelihood) and species tree (NJst) approaches (after showing that mean branch support appears to be related to accuracy). We found that both approaches had the highest support when including loci with up to 50\% missing taxa (matrices with {\textasciitilde}40–55\% missing data overall). Thus, our results show that simply excluding all missing data may be highly problematic as the primary guiding principle for the inclusion or exclusion of taxa and genes. The optimal strategy was somewhat different for each approach, a pattern that has not been shown previously. For concatenated analyses, branch support was maximized when including many taxa (44) but fewer characters (1.1 million). For species-tree analyses, branch support was maximized with minimal taxon sampling (16) but many loci (4,789 of 4,921). We also show that the choice of these sampling strategies can be critically important for phylogenomic analyses, since some strategies lead to demonstrably incorrect inferences (using the same method) that have strong statistical support. Our preferred estimate provides strong support for most interfamilial relationships in this important but phylogenetically challenging group.},

Key among those deficiencies was the lack of post-deployment extensibility. BEAST 2 now has a fully developed package management system that allows third party developers to write additional functionality that can be directly installed to the BEAST 2 analysis platform via a package manager without requiring a new software release of the platform. This package architecture is showcased with a number of recently published new models encompassing birth-death-sampling tree priors, phylodynamics and model averaging for substitution models and site partitioning. A second major improvement is the ability to read/write the entire state of the MCMC chain to/from disk allowing it to be easily shared between multiple instances of the BEAST software. This facilitates checkpointing and better support for multi-processor and high-end computing extensions. Finally, the functionality in new packages can be easily added to the user interface (BEAUti 2) by a simple XML template-based mechanism because BEAST 2 has been re-designed to provide greater integration between the analysis engine and the user interface so that, for example BEAST and BEAUti use exactly the same XML file format.},

Today thousands of genes can be sequenced for a given study, but using that many genes with *BEAST is intractably slow. One alternative is concatenation, which assumes that the evolutionary history of each gene tree is identical to the species tree. This is an inconsistent estimator of species tree topology, and a worse estimator of divergence times. Concatenation also induces spurious substitution rate variation when incomplete lineage sorting is present. Another alternative is to use summary MSC methods like ASTRAL, but such methods are also unsatisfactory because they infer branch lengths in coalescent units, and so cannot estimate divergence times. To enable fuller use of available data and more accurate inference of species tree topologies, divergence times, and substitution rates, we have developed a new version of *BEAST called StarBEAST2. To improve convergence rates we add analytical integration of population sizes and novel MCMC operators which improved computational performance by 3.1x when analyzing a single empirical data set, and an average of 6.2x across 96 simulated data sets. Convergence rates are also more consistent between chains than *BEAST. To enable accurate estimates of per-species substitution rates we introduce species tree relaxed clocks, and show that StarBEAST2 is a more powerful and robust estimator of rate variation than concatenation. StarBEAST2 is available through the BEAUTi package manager in BEAST 2.4 and above.},

	abstract = {With the increasing availability of whole genome data, many species trees are being constructed from hundreds to thousands of loci. Although concatenation analysis using maximum likelihood is a standard approach for estimating species trees, it does not account for gene tree heterogeneity, which can occur due to many biological processes, such as incomplete lineage sorting. Coalescent species tree estimation methods, many of which are statistically consistent in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting, include Bayesian methods that co-estimate the gene trees and the species tree, summary methods that compute the species tree by combining estimated gene trees, and site-based methods that infer the species tree from site patterns in the alignments of different loci. Due to concerns that poor quality loci will reduce the accuracy of estimated species trees, many recent phylogenomic studies have removed or filtered genes on the basis of phylogenetic signal and/or missing data prior to inferring species trees; little is known about the performance of species tree estimation methods when gene filtering is performed.We examine how incomplete lineage sorting, phylogenetic signal of individual loci, and missing data affect the absolute and the relative accuracy of species tree estimation methods and show how these properties affect methods’ responses to gene filtering strategies. In particular, summary methods (ASTRAL-II, ASTRID, and MP-EST), a site-based coalescent method (SVDquartets within PAUP*), and an unpartitioned concatenation analysis using maximum likelihood (RAxML) were evaluated on a heterogeneous collection of simulated multi-locus datasets, and the following trends were observed. Filtering genes based on gene tree estimation error improved the accuracy of the summary methods when levels of incomplete lineage sorting were low to moderate but did not benefit the summary methods under higher levels of incomplete lineage sorting, unless gene tree estimation error was also extremely high (a model condition with few replicates). Neither SVDquartets nor concatenation analysis using RAxML benefited from filtering genes on the basis of gene tree estimation error. Finally, filtering genes based on missing data was either neutral (i.e., did not impact accuracy) or else reduced the accuracy of all five methods. By providing insight into the consequences of gene filtering, we offer recommendations for estimating species tree in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting and reconcile seemingly conflicting observations made in prior studies regarding the impact of gene filtering.},

	abstract = {Accurate gene tree inference is an important aspect of species tree estimation in a summary-coalescent framework. Yet, in empirical studies, inferred gene trees differ in accuracy due to stochastic variation in phylogenetic signal between targeted loci. Empiricists should, therefore, examine the consistency of species tree inference, while accounting for the observed heterogeneity in gene tree resolution of phylogenomic data sets. Here, we assess the impact of gene tree estimation error on summary-coalescent species tree inference by screening [Formula: see text] exonic loci based on gene tree resolution prior to phylogenetic inference. We focus on a phylogenetically challenging radiation of Australian lizards (genus Cryptoblepharus, Scincidae) and explore effects on topology and support. We identify a well-supported topology based on all loci and find that a relatively small number of high-resolution gene trees can be sufficient to converge on the same topology. Adding gene trees with decreasing resolution produced a generally consistent topology, and increased confidence for specific bipartitions that were poorly supported when using a small number of informative loci. This corroborates coalescent-based simulation studies that have highlighted the need for a large number of loci to confidently resolve challenging relationships and refutes the notion that low-resolution gene trees introduce phylogenetic noise. Further, our study also highlights the value of quantifying changes in nodal support across locus subsets of increasing size (but decreasing gene tree resolution). Such detailed analyses can reveal anomalous fluctuations in support at some nodes, suggesting the possibility of model violation. By characterizing the heterogeneity in phylogenetic signal among loci, we can account for uncertainty in gene tree estimation and assess its effect on the consistency of the species tree estimate. We suggest that the evaluation of gene tree resolution should be incorporated in the analysis of empirical phylogenomic data sets. This will ultimately increase our confidence in species tree estimation using summary-coalescent methods and enable us to exploit genomic data for phylogenetic inference.

Phylogenetic methods known as "species tree" methods have been proposed to directly address one important source of gene tree heterogeneity, namely the incomplete lineage sorting that occurs when evolving lineages radiate rapidly, resulting in a diversity of gene trees from a single underlying species tree. Here we review theory and empirical examples that help clarify conflicts between species tree and concatenation methods, and misconceptions in the literature about the performance of species tree methods. Considering concatenation as a special case of the multispecies coalescent model helps explain differences in the behavior of the two methods on phylogenomic data sets. Recent work suggests that species tree methods are more robust than concatenation approaches to some of the classic challenges of phylogenetic analysis, including rapidly evolving sites in DNA sequences and long-branch attraction. We show that approaches, such as binning, designed to augment the signal in species tree analyses can distort the distribution of gene trees and are inconsistent.

To reduce incongruence, phylogenomic studies normally adopt some data filtering approaches, such as reducing missing data or using slowly evolving genes, to improve the signal quality of data. Here, we assembled a phylogenomic data set of 58 jawed vertebrate taxa and 4,682 genes to investigate the backbone phylogeny of jawed vertebrates under both concatenation and coalescent-based frameworks. To evaluate the efficiency of extracting phylogenetic signals among different data filtering methods, we chose six highly intractable internodes within the backbone phylogeny of jawed vertebrates as our test questions. We found that our phylogenomic data set exhibits substantial conflicting signal among genes for these questions. Our analyses showed that non-specific data sets that are generated without bias towards specific questions are not sufficient to produce consistent results when there are several difficult nodes within a phylogeny. Moreover, phylogenetic accuracy based on non-specific data is considerably influenced by the size of data and the choice of tree inference methods. To address such incongruences, we selected genes that resolve a given internode but not the entire phylogeny. Notably, not only can this strategy yield correct relationships for the question, but it also reduces inconsistency associated with data sizes and inference methods. Our study highlights the importance of gene selection in phylogenomic analyses, suggesting that simply using a large amount of data cannot guarantee correct results. Constructing question-specific data sets may be more powerful for resolving problematic nodes.},

	abstract = {Coalescent-based methods for species-tree estimation are becoming a dominant approach for reconstructing species histories from multi-locus data, with most of the studies examining these methodologies focused on recently diverged species. However, deeper phylogenies, such as the datasets that comprise many Tree of Life (ToL) studies, also exhibit gene-tree discordance. This discord may also arise from the stochastic sorting of gene lineages during the speciation process (i.e., reflecting the random coalescence of gene lineages in ancestral populations). It remains unknown whether guidelines regarding methodologies and numbers of loci established by simulation studies at shallow tree depths translate into accurate species relationships for deeper phylogenetic histories. We address this knowledge gap and specifically identify the challenges and limitations of species-tree methods that account for coalescent variance for deeper phylogenies. Using simulated data with characteristics informed by empirical studies, we evaluate both the accuracy of estimated species trees and the characteristics associated with recalcitrant nodes, with a specific focus on whether coalescent variance is generally responsible for the lack of resolution. By determining the proportion of coalescent genealogies that support a particular node, we demonstrate that (1) species-tree methods account for coalescent variance at deep nodes and (2) mutational variance - not gene-tree discord arising from the coalescent - posed the primary challenge for accurate reconstruction across the tree. For example, many nodes were accurately resolved despite predicted discord from the random coalescence of gene lineages and nodes with poor support were distributed across a range of depths (i.e., they were not restricted to a particular recent divergences). Given their broad taxonomic scope and large sampling of taxa, deep level phylogenies pose several potential methodological complications including difficulties with MCMC convergence and estimation of requisite population genetic parameters for coalescent-based approaches. Despite these difficulties, the findings generally support the utility of species-tree analyses for the estimation of species relationships throughout the ToL. We discuss strategies for successful application of species-tree approaches to deep phylogenies.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetics is undergoing a revolution as large-scale molecular datasets reveal unexpected but repeatable rearrangements of clades that were previously thought to be disparate lineages. One of the most unusual clades of fishes that has been found using large-scale molecular datasets is an expanded Syngnathiformes including traditional long-snouted syngnathiform lineages (Aulostomidae, Centriscidae, Fistulariidae, Solenostomidae, Syngnathidae), as well as a diverse set of largely benthic-associated fishes (Callionymoidei, Dactylopteridae, Mullidae, Pegasidae) that were previously dispersed across three orders. The monophyly of this surprising clade of fishes has been upheld by recent studies utilizing both nuclear and mitogenomic data, but the relationships among major lineages within Syngnathiformes remain ambiguous; previous analyses have inconsistent topologies and are plagued by low support at deep divergences between the major lineages. In this study, we use a dataset of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) to conduct the first phylogenomic study of Syngnathiformes. UCEs have been effective markers for resolving deep phylogenetic relationships in fishes and, combined with increased taxon sampling, we expected UCEs to resolve problematic syngnathiform relationships. Overall, UCEs were effective at resolving relationships within Syngnathiformes at a range of evolutionary timescales. We find consistent support for the monophyly of traditional long-snouted syngnathiform lineages (Aulostomidae, Centriscidae, Fistulariidae, Solenostomidae, Syngnathidae), which better agrees with morphological hypotheses than previously published topologies from molecular data. This result was supported by all Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses, was robust to differences in matrix completeness and potential sources of bias, and was highly supported in coalescent-based analyses in ASTRAL when matrices were filtered to contain the most phylogenetically informative loci. While Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses found support for a benthic-associated clade (Callionymidae, Dactylopteridae, Mullidae, and Pegasidae) as sister to the long-snouted clade, this result was not replicated in the ASTRAL analyses. The base of our phylogeny is characterized by short internodes separating major syngnathiform lineages and is consistent with the hypothesis of an ancient rapid radiation at the base of Syngnathiformes. Syngnathiformes therefore present an exciting opportunity to study patterns of morphological variation and functional innovation arising from rapid but ancient radiation.},

	abstract = {Higher-level relationships among placental mammals are mostly resolved, but several polytomies remain contentious. Song et al. (2012) claimed to have resolved three of these using shortcut coalescence methods (MP-EST, STAR) and further concluded that these methods, which assume no within-locus recombination, are required to unravel deep-level phylogenetic problems that have stymied concatenation. Here, we reanalyze Song et al.’s (2012) data and leverage these re-analyses to explore key issues in systematics including the recombination ratchet, gene tree stoichiometry, the proportion of gene tree incongruence that results from deep coalescence versus other factors, and simulations that compare the performance of coalescence and concatenation methods in species tree estimation. Song et al. (2012) reported an average locus length of 3.1 kb for the 447 protein-coding genes in their phylogenomic dataset, but the true mean length of these loci (start codon to stop codon) is 139.6 kb. Empirical estimates of recombination breakpoints in primates, coupled with consideration of the recombination ratchet, suggest that individual coalescence genes (c-genes) approach ∼12 bp or less for Song et al.’s (2012) dataset, three to four orders of magnitude shorter than the c-genes reported by these authors. This result has general implications for the application of coalescence methods in species tree estimation. We contend that it is illogical to apply coalescence methods to complete protein-coding sequences. Such analyses amalgamate c-genes with different evolutionary histories (i.e., exons separated by {\textgreater}100,000 bp), distort true gene tree stoichiometry that is required for accurate species tree inference, and contradict the central rationale for applying coalescence methods to difficult phylogenetic problems. In addition, Song et al.’s (2012) dataset of 447 genes includes 21 loci with switched taxonomic names, eight duplicated loci, 26 loci with non-homologous sequences that are grossly misaligned, and numerous loci with {\textgreater}50\% missing data for taxa that are misplaced in their gene trees. These problems were compounded by inadequate tree searches with nearest neighbor interchange branch swapping and inadvertent application of substitution models that did not account for among-site rate heterogeneity. Sixty-six gene trees imply unrealistic deep coalescences that exceed 100 million years (MY). Gene trees that were obtained with better justified models and search parameters show large increases in both likelihood scores and congruence. Coalescence analyses based on a curated set of 413 improved gene trees and a superior coalescence method (ASTRAL) support a Scandentia (treeshrews) + Glires (rabbits, rodents) clade, contradicting one of the three primary systematic conclusions of Song et al. (2012). Robust support for a Perissodactyla + Carnivora clade within Laurasiatheria is also lost, contradicting a second major conclusion of this study. Song et al.’s (2012) MP-EST species tree provided the basis for circular simulations that led these authors to conclude that the multispecies coalescent accounts for 77\% of the gene tree conflicts in their dataset, but internal branches of their MP-EST tree are stunted by an order of magnitude due to wholesale gene tree reconstruction errors. An independent assessment of branch lengths suggests the multispecies coalescent accounts for ⩽ 15\% of the conflicts among Song et al.’s (2012) 447 gene trees. Unfortunately, Song et al.’s (2012) flawed phylogenomic dataset has been used as a model for additional simulation work that suggests the superiority of shortcut coalescence methods relative to concatenation. Investigator error was passed on to the subsequent simulation studies, which also incorporated further logical errors that should be avoided in future simulation studies. Illegitimate branch length switches in the simulation routines unfairly protected coalescence methods from their Achilles’ heel, high gene tree reconstruction error at short internodes. These simulations therefore provide no evidence that shortcut coalescence methods out-compete concatenation at deep timescales. In summary, the long c-genes that are required for accurate reconstruction of species trees using shortcut coalescence methods do not exist and are a delusion. Coalescence approaches based on SNPs that are widely spaced in the genome avoid problems with the recombination ratchet and merit further pursuit in both empirical systematic research and simulations.},

The advantage of revPoMo is that an increase of sample size per species improves estimations but does not increase runtime. Therefore, revPoMo is a valuable tool with several applications, from speciation dating to species tree reconstruction.},

We tested whether site-wise bootstrap analyses provide consistently more conservative support than gene-wise bootstrap analyses. We did so using data from three empirical phylogenomic studies and employed four coalescent methods (ASTRAL, MP-EST, NJst, and STAR). We demonstrate that application of site-wise bootstrapping generally resulted in gene-trees with substantial additional conflicts relative to the original data and this approach therefore cannot be relied upon to provide conservative support. Instead the site-wise bootstrap can provide high support for apparently incorrect clades. We provide a script (https://github.com/dbsloan/msc\_tree\_resampling) that implements gene-wise resampling, using either the bootstrap or the jackknife, for use with ASTRAL, MP-EST, NJst, and STAR. We demonstrate that the gene-wise bootstrap outperformed the site-wise bootstrap for the primary focal clades for all four coalescent methods that were applied to all three empirical studies. For summary coalescent analyses we suggest that gene-wise resampling support should be favored over gene + site or site-wise resampling when numerous genes are sampled because site-wise resampling causes substantially greater gene-tree-estimation error.},

	abstract = {Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have led to a ubiquity of molecular sequence data. This data avalanche is particularly challenging in metagenetics, which focuses on taxonomic identification of sequences obtained from diverse microbial environments. To achieve this, phylogenetic placement methods determine how these sequences fit into an evolutionary context. Previous implementations of phylogenetic placement algorithms, such as the Evolutionary Placement Algorithm (EPA) included in RAxML, or pplacer, are being increasingly used for this purpose. However, due to the steady progress in NGS technologies, the current implementations face substantial scalability limitations. Here we present EPA-ng, a complete reimplementation of the EPA that is substantially faster, offers a distributed memory parallelization, and integrates concepts from both, RAxML-EPA, and pplacer. EPA-ng can be executed on standard shared memory, as well as on distributed memory systems (e.g., computing clusters). To demonstrate the scalability of EPA-ng we placed 1 billion metagenetic reads from the Tara Oceans Project onto a reference tree with 3,748 taxa in just under 7 hours, using 2,048 cores. Our performance assessment shows that EPA-ng outperforms RAxML-EPA and pplacer by up to a factor of 30 in sequential execution mode, while attaining comparable parallel efficiency on shared memory systems. We further show that the distributed memory parallelization of EPA-ng scales well up to 3,520 cores. EPA-ng is available under the AGPLv3 license: https://github.com/Pbdas/epa-ng},

The species tree is estimated by the neighbor joining (NJ) tree built from a distance matrix in which the distance between two species is defined as the average number of internodes between two species across gene trees, that is, average gene-tree internode distance. The distance method is named NJ(st) to distinguish it from the original NJ method. Under the coalescent model, we show that if gene trees are known or estimated correctly, the NJ(st) method is statistically consistent in estimating unrooted species trees. The simulation results suggest that NJ(st) and STAR (another coalescence-based method for inferring species trees) perform almost equally well in estimating topologies of species trees, whereas the Bayesian coalescence-based method, BEST, outperforms both NJ(st) and STAR. Unlike BEST and STAR, the NJ(st) method can take unrooted gene trees to infer species trees without using an outgroup. In addition, the NJ(st) method can handle missing data and is thus useful in phylogenomic studies in which data sets often contain missing loci for some individuals.},

Odontophorid quail are widespread in tropical and temperate habitats in the Americas, yet recent phylogenetic studies support the view that they are sister to sub-Saharan African Ptilopachus rather than the widespread Phasianidae as formerly believed. To understand how this 10,000 km range disjunction arose in relatively non-vagile birds, we reconstructed colonization history and diversification of odontophorids with respect to hypothesized dry-land connections between continents (North Atlantic, Beringian, Panamanian) that would have facilitated faunal exchange. Location Africa, Nearctic and Neotropics. Methods We inferred a fossil-calibrated odontophorid phylogeny from DNA sequences (three mitochondrial genes and eight nuclear introns) and modelled ancestral ranges with six probabilistic biogeographical models. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to select the best-fit biogeographical model. Results Ptilopachus and New World quail shared an Old World ancestor c. 32 Ma. During this period, Beringia connected the Nearctic and Palaearctic, and global temperatures were high, such that presence of temperate organisms at high latitudes and direct dispersal across land connections were feasible. The extant New World quail began diversifying in Central America c. 18 Ma; timing estimates and ancestral range reconstructions support the hypothesis that New World quail colonized and diversified in South America following closure of the Isthmus of Panama. Main conclusions The Africa/New World range disjunction between New World quail and Ptilopachus is the result of changes in Earth and climate history, combined with range expansion and diversification in the New World, and range contraction in the Old World. We find no evidence for overwater dispersal in New World quail.},

	abstract = {Current efforts to reconstruct the tree of life and histories of multigene families demand the inference of phylogenies consisting of thousands of gene sequences. However, for such large data sets even a moderate exploration of the tree space needed to identify the optimal tree is virtually impossible. For these cases the neighbor-joining (NJ) method is frequently used because of its demonstrated accuracy for smaller data sets and its computational speed. As data sets grow, however, the fraction of the tree space examined by the NJ algorithm becomes minuscule. Here, we report the results of our computer simulation for examining the accuracy of NJ trees for inferring very large phylogenies. First we present a likelihood method for the simultaneous estimation of all pairwise distances by using biologically realistic models of nucleotide substitution. Use of this method corrects up to 60\% of NJ tree errors. Our simulation results show that the accuracy of NJ trees decline only by ≈5\% when the number of sequences used increases from 32 to 4,096 (128 times) even in the presence of extensive variation in the evolutionary rate among lineages or significant biases in the nucleotide composition and transition/transversion ratio. Our results encourage the use of complex models of nucleotide substitution for estimating evolutionary distances and hint at bright prospects for the application of the NJ and related methods in inferring large phylogenies.},

However, distance-based dating of speciation events and the test of the molecular clock hypothesis are relatively underdeveloped. Here I develop an approximate test of the molecular clock hypothesis for distance-based trees, as well as information-theoretic indices that have been used frequently in model selection, for use with distance matrices. The results are in good agreement with the conventional sequence-based likelihood ratio test. Among the information-theoretic indices, AICu is the most consistent with the sequence-based likelihood ratio test. The confidence in model selection by the indices can be evaluated by bootstrapping. I illustrate the usage of the indices and the approximate significance test with both empirical and simulated sequences. The tests show that distance matrices from protein gel electrophoresis and from genome rearrangement events do not violate the molecular clock hypothesis, and that the evolution of the third codon position conforms to the molecular clock hypothesis better than the second codon position in vertebrate mitochondrial genes.

Skin protects humans from invasion by pathogenic microorganisms and provides a home for diverse commensal microbiota. Bacterial genomic sequence data have generated novel hypotheses about species and community structures underlying human disorders. However, microbial diversity is not limited to bacteria; microorganisms such as fungi also have major roles in microbial community stability, human health and disease. Genomic methodologies to identify fungal species and communities have been limited compared with those that are available for bacteria. Fungal evolution can be reconstructed with phylogenetic markers, including ribosomal RNA gene regions and other highly conserved genes. Here we sequenced and analysed fungal communities of 14 skin sites in 10 healthy adults. Eleven core-body and arm sites were dominated by fungi of the genus Malassezia, with only species-level classifications revealing fungal-community composition differences between sites. By contrast, three foot sites--plantar heel, toenail and toe web--showed high fungal diversity. Concurrent analysis of bacterial and fungal communities demonstrated that physiologic attributes and topography of skin differentially shape these two microbial communities. These results provide a framework for future investigation of the contribution of interactions between pathogenic and commensal fungal and bacterial communities to the maintainenace of human health and to disease pathogenesis.},

Methods successfully exploited for prokaryotic genome analysis have proved difficult to apply to eukaryotes, however, as larger genomes may contain multiple paralogous genes, and sequence information is often incomplete. OrthoMCL provides a scalable method for constructing orthologous groups across multiple eukaryotic taxa, using a Markov Cluster algorithm to group (putative) orthologs and paralogs. This method performs similarly to the INPARANOID algorithm when applied to two genomes, but can be extended to cluster orthologs from multiple species. OrthoMCL clusters are coherent with groups identified by EGO, but improved recognition of “recent” paralogs permits overlapping EGO groups representing the same gene to be merged. Comparison with previously assigned EC annotations suggests a high degree of reliability, implying utility for automated eukaryotic genome annotation. OrthoMCL has been applied to the proteome data set from seven publicly available genomes (human, fly, worm, yeast, Arabidopsis, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and Escherichia coli). A Web interface allows queries based on individual genes or user-defined phylogenetic patterns (http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/gene-family). Analysis of clusters incorporating P. falciparum genes identifies numerous enzymes that were incompletely annotated in first-pass annotation of the parasite genome.},

Furthermore, the ratio of sequencing coverage between the peak and trough provides a quantitative measure of a species’ growth rate. We demonstrate this in vitro and in vivo, under different growth conditions, and in complex bacterial communities.

In such problems, almost all the instances are labelled as one class, while far fewer instances are labelled as the other class, usually the more important class. It is obvious that traditional classifiers seeking an accurate performance over a full range of instances are not suitable to deal with imbalanced learning tasks, since they tend to classify all the data into the majority class, which is usually the less important class. This paper describes various techniques for handling imbalance dataset problems. Of course, a single article cannot be a complete review of all the methods and algorithms, yet we hope that the references cited will cover the major theoretical issues, guiding the researcher in interesting research directions and suggesting possible bias combinations that have yet to be explored.},

	abstract = {While current major national research efforts (i.e., the NIH Human Microbiome Project) will enable comprehensive metagenomic characterization of the adult human microbiota, how and when these diverse microbial communities take up residence in the host and during reproductive life are unexplored at a population level. Because microbial abundance and diversity might differ in pregnancy, we sought to generate comparative metagenomic signatures across gestational age strata. DNA was isolated from the vagina (introitus, posterior fornix, midvagina) and the V5V3 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes were sequenced (454FLX Titanium platform). Sixty-eight samples from 24 healthy gravidae (18 to 40 confirmed weeks) were compared with 301 non-pregnant controls (60 subjects). Generated sequence data were quality filtered, taxonomically binned, normalized, and organized by phylogeny and into operational taxonomic units (OTU); principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of the resultant beta diversity measures were used for visualization and analysis in association with sample clinical metadata. Altogether, 1.4 gigabytes of data containing {\textgreater}2.5 million reads (averaging 6,837 sequences/sample of 493 nt in length) were generated for computational analyses. Although gravidae were not excluded by virtue of a posterior fornix pH {\textgreater}4.5 at the time of screening, unique vaginal microbiome signature encompassing several specific OTUs and higher-level clades was nevertheless observed and confirmed using a combination of phylogenetic, non-phylogenetic, supervised, and unsupervised approaches. Both overall diversity and richness were reduced in pregnancy, with dominance of Lactobacillus species (L. iners crispatus, jensenii and johnsonii, and the orders Lactobacillales (and Lactobacillaceae family), Clostridiales, Bacteroidales, and Actinomycetales. This intergroup comparison using rigorous standardized sampling protocols and analytical methodologies provides robust initial evidence that the vaginal microbial 16S rRNA gene catalogue uniquely differs in pregnancy, with variance of taxa across vaginal subsite and gestational age.},

These three techniques include genetic programming (GP), random forests (RF), and logistic regression (LR). We evaluate the classification accuracy of each of these techniques on two different datasets. We then deconstruct the classification models to identify important features of the microbial community. We found that the classification models produced by the machine learning techniques obtained accuracies above 90\% for Nugent score BV and above 80\% for Amsel criteria BV. While the classification models identify largely different sets of important features, the shared features often agree with past research.},

Here, we present the largest human microbiota time series analysis to date, covering two individuals at four body sites over 396 timepoints.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: We find that despite stable differences between body sites and individuals, there is pronounced variability in an individual’s microbiota across months, weeks and even days. Additionally, only a small fraction of the total taxa found within a single body site appear to be present across all time points, suggesting that no core temporal microbiome exists at high abundance (although some microbes may be present but drop below the detection threshold). Many more taxa appear to be persistent but non-permanent community members.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: DNA sequencing and computational advances described here provide the ability to go beyond infrequent snapshots of our human-associated microbial ecology to high-resolution assessments of temporal variations over protracted periods, within and between body habitats and individuals.

	abstract = {Background \& Aims: The intestinal microbiomes of healthy children and pediatric patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are not well defined. Studies in adults have indicated that the gastrointestinal microbiota could be involved in IBS. Methods: We analyzed 71 samples from 22 children with IBS (pediatric Rome III criteria) and 22 healthy children, ages 7-12 years, by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, with an average of 54,287 reads/stool sample (average 454 read length = 503 bases). Data were analyzed using phylogenetic-based clustering (Unifrac), or an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) approach using a supervised machine learning tool (randomForest). Most samples were also hybridized to a microarray that can detect 8741 bacterial taxa (16S rRNA PhyloChip). Results: Microbiomes associated with pediatric IBS were characterized by a significantly greater percentage of the class γ-proteobacteria (0.07\% vs 0.89\% of total bacteria, respectively; P {\textless} .05); 1 prominent component of this group was Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Differences highlighted by 454 sequencing were confirmed by high-resolution PhyloChip analysis. Using supervised learning techniques, we were able to classify different subtypes of IBS with a success rate of 98.5\%, using limited sets of discriminant bacterial species. A novel Ruminococcus-like microbe was associated with IBS, indicating the potential utility of microbe discovery for gastrointestinal disorders. A greater frequency of pain correlated with an increased abundance of several bacterial taxa from the genus Alistipes. Conclusions: Using16S metagenomics by PhyloChip DNA hybridization and deep 454 pyrosequencing, we associated specific microbiome signatures with pediatric IBS. These findings indicate the important association between gastrointestinal microbes and IBS in children; these approaches might be used in diagnosis of functional bowel disorders in pediatric patients. © 2011 AGA Institute.},

	abstract = {Two recent studies have reanalyzed previously published data and found that when data sets were analyzed independently, there was limited support for the widely accepted hypothesis that changes in the microbiome are associated with obesity. This hypothesis was reconsidered by increasing the number of data sets and pooling the results across the individual data sets. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines were used to identify 10 studies for an updated and more synthetic analysis. Alpha diversity metrics and the relative risk of obesity based on those metrics were used to identify a limited number of significant associations with obesity; however, when the results of the studies were pooled by using a random-effect model, significant associations were observed among Shannon diversity, the number of observed operational taxonomic units, Shannon evenness, and obesity status. They were not observed for the ratio of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes or their individual relative abundances. Although these tests yielded small P values, the difference between the Shannon diversity indices of nonobese and obese individuals was 2.07\%. A power analysis demonstrated that only one of the studies had sufficient power to detect a 5\% difference in diversity. When random forest machine learning models were trained on one data set and then tested by using the other nine data sets, the median accuracy varied between 33.01 and 64.77\% (median, 56.68\%). Although there was support for a relationship between the microbial communities found in human feces and obesity status, this association was relatively weak and its detection is confounded by large interpersonal variation and insufficient sample sizes.},

The microbiota far outnumber the human component of our selves, with 10 times more cells and at least 100 times more genes. Moreover, while individuals share over 99.9\% of their human genome sequence, there are vast differences in the microbiome (the collection of genes of our associated microbes).

Tests of hypotheses to account for such diversity have been stymied by the lack of a fully resolved broad-scale phylogeny. Here, we provide such a phylogeny, based on 75 chloroplast genes for 39 species representing all orchid subfamilies and 16 of 17 tribes, time-calibrated against 17 angiosperm fossils. A supermatrix analysis places an additional 144 species based on three plastid genes. Orchids appear to have arisen roughly 112 million years ago (Mya); the subfamilies Orchidoideae and Epidendroideae diverged from each other at the end of the Cretaceous; and the eight tribes and three previously unplaced subtribes of the upper epidendroids diverged rapidly from each other between 37.9 and 30.8 Mya. Orchids appear to have undergone one significant acceleration of net species diversification in the orchidoids, and two accelerations and one deceleration in the upper epidendroids. Consistent with theory, such accelerations were correlated with the evolution of pollinia, the epiphytic habit, CAM photosynthesis, tropical distribution (especially in extensive cordilleras), and pollination via Lepidoptera or euglossine bees. Deceit pollination appears to have elevated the number of orchid species by one-half but not via acceleration of the rate of net diversification. The highest rate of net species diversification within the orchids (0.382 sp sp(-1) My(-1)) is 6.8 times that at the Asparagales crown.},

	abstract = {The Human Genome Project was completed a decade ago, leaving a legacy of process, tools, and infrastructure now being turned to the study of the microbes that reside in and on the human body as determinants of health and disease, and has been branded "The Human Microbiome Project." Of the various niches under investigation, the human gut houses the most complex and abundant microbial community and is an arena for important host-microbial interactions that have both local and systemic impact. Initial studies of the human microbiome have been largely descriptive, a testing ground for innovative molecular techniques and new hypotheses. Methods for studying the microbiome have quickly evolved from low-resolution surveys of microbial community structure to high-definition description of composition, function, and ecology. Next-generation sequencing technologies combined with advanced bioinformatics place us at the doorstep of revolutionary insight into the composition, capability, and activity of the human intestinal microbiome. Renewed efforts to cultivate previously "uncultivable" microbes will be important to the overall understanding of gut ecology. There remain numerous methodological challenges to the effective study and understanding of the gut microbiome, largely relating to study design, sample collection, and the number of predictor variables. Strategic collaboration of clinicians, microbiologists, molecular biologists, computational scientists, and bioinformaticians is the ideal paradigm for success in this field. Meaningful interpretation of the gut microbiome requires that host genetic and environmental influences be controlled or accounted for. Understanding the gut microbiome in healthy humans is a foundation for discovering its influence in various important gastrointestinal and nutritional diseases (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and obesity), and for rational translation to human health gains. © 2012 Mosby, Inc.

Problems with the 'product rule' for forensic identification have been highlighted by several authors, but important aspects of the problems are not widely appreciated. This arises in part because the match probability has often been confused with the relative frequency of the profile. Further, the analogous problems in paternity cases have received little attention. The proposed method is derived under general assumptions about the underlying population genetic processes. Probabilities relevant to forensic inference are expressed in terms of a single parameter whose values can be chosen to reflect the specific circumstances. The method is currently used in some UK courts and has important advantages over the 'Ceiling Principle' method, which has been criticized on a number of grounds.},

	abstract = {Economically, legumes (Fabaceae) represent the second most important family of crop plants after the grass family, Poaceae. Grain legumes account for 27\% of world crop production and provide 33\% of the dietary protein consumed by humans, while pasture and forage legumes provide vital part of animal feed. Fabaceae, the third largest family of flowering plants, has traditionally been divided into the following three subfamilies: Caesalpinioideae, Mimosoideae, and Papilionoideae, all together with 800 genera and 20,000 species. The latter subfamily contains most of the major cultivated food and feed crops. Among the grain legumes are some of mankind's earliest crop plants, whose domestication parallelled that of cereals: Soybean in China; faba bean, lentil, chickpea and pea in the Fertile Crescent of the Near East; cowpeas and bambara groundnut in Africa; soybean and mungbeans in East Asia; pigeonpea and the grams in South Asia; and common bean, lima bean, scarlet runner bean, tepary bean and lupin in Central and South America. The importance of legumes is evidenced by their high representation in ex situ germplasm collections, with more than 1,000,000 accessions worldwide. A detailed knowledge of the phylogenetic relationships of the Fabaceae is essential for understanding the origin and diversification of this economically and ecologically important family of angiosperms. This review aims to combine the phylogenetic and genetic diversity approaches to better illustrate the origin, domestication history and preserved germplasm of major legume crops from 13 genera of six tribes and to indicate further potential both for science and agriculture.},

Analyses of nucleotide sequence variations in 106 cereal chloroplast genes with tobacco sequences as the outgroup suggested that (1) most of the genic regions of the chloroplast genomes of maize, rice, and wheat have evolved at similar rates; (2) RNA genes have highly conservative evolutionary rates relative to the other genes; (3) photosynthetic genes have been under strong purifying selection; (4) between the three cereals, 14 genes which account for about 28\% of the genic region have evolved with heterogeneous nucleotide substitution rates; and (5) rice genes tend to have evolved more slowly than the others at loci where rate heterogeneity exists. Although the mechanism that underlies chloroplast gene diversification is complex, our analyses identified variation in nonsynonymous substitution rates as a genetic force that generates heterogeneity, which is evidence of selection in chloroplast gene diversification at the intrafamilial level. Phylogenetic trees constructed with the variable nucleotide sites of the chloroplast genes place maize basal to the rice-wheat clade, revealing a close relationship between the Bambusoideae and Pooideae.},

We present phylogenetic analyses based on 264 individual plants, each genotyped at 99 microsatellites, that challenge the multiple-origins hypothesis. Instead, our results indicate that all maize arose from a single domestication in southern Mexico about 9,000 years ago. Our analyses also indicate that the oldest surviving maize types are those of the Mexican highlands with maize spreading from this region over the Americas along two major paths. Our phylogenetic work is consistent with a model based on the archaeological record suggesting that maize diversified in the highlands of Mexico before spreading to the lowlands. We also found only modest evidence for postdomestication gene flow from teosinte into maize.},

Clarification of phylogenetic relationships of rice genomes is critical for effective utilization of the wild rice germ plasm. By generating and comparing two nuclear gene (Adh1 and Adh2) trees and a chloroplast gene (matK) tree of all rice species, phylogenetic relationships among the rice genomes were inferred. Origins of the allotetraploid species, which constitute more than one-third of rice species diversity, were reconstructed based on the Adh gene phylogenies. Genome types of the maternal parents of allotetraploid species were determined based on the matK gene tree. The phylogenetic reconstruction largely supports the previous recognition of rice genomes. It further revealed that the EE genome species is most closely related to the DD genome progenitor that gave rise to the CCDD genome. Three species of the CCDD genome may have originated through a single hybridization event, and their maternal parent had the CC genome. The BBCC genome species had different origins, and their maternal parents had either a BB or CC genome. An additional genome type, HHKK, was recognized for Oryza schlechteri and Porteresia coarctata, suggesting that P. coarctata is an Oryza species. The AA genome lineage, which contains cultivated rice, is a recently diverged and rapidly radiated lineage within the rice genus.},

	abstract = {The domestication of all major crop plants occurred during a brief period in human history about 10,000 years ago. During this time, ancient agriculturalists selected seed of preferred forms and culled out seed of undesirable types to produce each subsequent generation. Consequently, favoured alleles at genes controlling traits of interest increased in frequency, ultimately reaching fixation. When selection is strong, domestication has the potential to drastically reduce genetic diversity in a crop. To understand the impact of selection during maize domestication, we examined nucleotide polymorphism in teosinte branched1, a gene involved in maize evolution. Here we show that the effects of selection were limited to the gene's regulatory region and cannot be detected in the protein-coding region. Although selection was apparently strong, high rates of recombination and a prolonged domestication period probably limited its effects. Our results help to explain why maize is such a variable crop. They also suggest that maize domestication required hundreds of years, and confirm previous evidence that maize was domesticated from Balsas teosinte of southwestern Mexico.},

Three datasets were used: two of simulated primate and mammalian phylogenies, and one of 20 real fly genomes. In total 35 submissions were assessed, submitted by ten teams using 12 different alignment pipelines. Conclusions: We found agreement between independent simulation-based and statistical assessments, indicating that there are substantial accuracy differences between contemporary alignment tools. We saw considerable difference in the alignment quality of differently annotated regions, and found few tools aligned the duplications analysed. We found many tools worked well at shorter evolutionary distances, but fewer performed competitively at longer distances.

Methods: In this implementation case study, we applied a monitoring system to the British Columbia drug treatment database, which holds more than 32 000 anonymised HIV genotypes for nearly 9000 residents of British Columbia living with HIV. On average, five to six new HIV genotypes are deposited in the database every day, which triggers an automated reanalysis of the entire database. We extracted clusters of five or more individuals with short phylogenetic distances between their respective HIV sequences. The system generated monthly reports of the growth and characteristics of clusters that were distributed to public health officers. Findings: In June, 2014, the monitoring system detected the expansion of a cluster by 11 new cases during 3 months, including eight cases with transmitted drug resistance. This cluster generally comprised young men who have sex with men. The subsequent report precipitated an enhanced public health follow-up to ensure linkage to care and treatment initiation in the affected subpopulation. Of the nine cases associated with this follow-up, all had already been linked to care and five cases had started treatment. Subsequent to the follow-up, three additional cases started treatment and most cases achieved suppressed viral loads. During the next 12 months, we detected 12 new cases in this cluster with reduction in the onward transmission of drug resistance. Interpretation: Our findings show the first application of an automated phylogenetic system monitoring a clinical database to detect a recent HIV outbreak and support the ensuing public health response. By making secondary use of routinely collected HIV genotypes, this approach is cost-effective, attains near real-time monitoring of new cases, and can be implemented in all settings in which HIV genotyping is the standard of care.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The estimated number of new HIV infections in the United States reflects the leading edge of the epidemic. Previously, CDC estimated HIV incidence in the United States in 2006 as 56,300 (95\% CI: 48,200-64,500). We updated the 2006 estimate and calculated incidence for 2007-2009 using improved methodology.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODOLOGY: We estimated incidence using incidence surveillance data from 16 states and 2 cities and a modification of our previously described stratified extrapolation method based on a sample survey approach with multiple imputation, stratification, and extrapolation to account for missing data and heterogeneity of HIV testing behavior among population groups.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Estimated HIV incidence among persons aged 13 years and older was 48,600 (95\% CI: 42,400-54,700) in 2006, 56,000 (95\% CI: 49,100-62,900) in 2007, 47,800 (95\% CI: 41,800-53,800) in 2008 and 48,100 (95\% CI: 42,200-54,000) in 2009. From 2006 to 2009 incidence did not change significantly overall or among specific race/ethnicity or risk groups. However, there was a 21\% (95\% CI:1.9\%-39.8\%; p = 0.017) increase in incidence for people aged 13-29 years, driven by a 34\% (95\% CI: 8.4\%-60.4\%) increase in young men who have sex with men (MSM). There was a 48\% increase among young black/African American MSM (12.3\%-83.0\%; p{\textless}0.001). Among people aged 13-29, only MSM experienced significant increases in incidence, and among 13-29 year-old MSM, incidence increased significantly among young, black/African American MSM. In 2009, MSM accounted for 61\% of new infections, heterosexual contact 27\%, injection drug use (IDU) 9\%, and MSM/IDU 3\%.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, HIV incidence in the United States was relatively stable 2006-2009; however, among young MSM, particularly black/African American MSM, incidence increased. HIV continues to be a major public health burden, disproportionately affecting several populations in the United States, especially MSM and racial and ethnic minorities. Expanded, improved, and targeted prevention is necessary to reduce HIV incidence.},

Population-based pol sequences were generated from collected blood samples and analyzed for genetic divergence over time in respect to dual infection status, HLA, CD4 count and viral load.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: 93 participants were observed for a median of 1.8 years (Mean = 2.2 years, SD =1.9 years). All participants classified as mono-infected had less than 0.7\% divergence between any two of their pol sequences using the Tamura-Nei model (TN93), while individuals with dual infection had up to 7.0\% divergence. The global substitution rates (substitutions/nucleotide/year) for mono and dually infected individuals were significantly different (p{\textless}0.001); however, substitution rates were not associated with HLA haplotype, CD4 or viral load.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Even after a maximum of almost 9 years of follow-up, all mono-infected participants had less than 1\% divergence between baseline and longitudinal sequences, while participants with dual infection had 10 times greater divergence.

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-11-532},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The occurrence of a genetic bottleneck in HIV sexual or mother-to-infant transmission has been well documented. This results in a majority of new infections being homogeneous, i.e., initiated by a single genetic strain. Early after infection, prior to the onset of the host immune response, the viral population grows exponentially. In this simple setting, an approach for estimating evolutionary and demographic parameters based on comparison of diversity measures is a feasible alternative to the existing Bayesian methods (e.g., BEAST), which are instead based on the simulation of genealogies.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: We have devised a web tool that analyzes genetic diversity in acutely infected HIV-1 patients by comparing it to a model of neutral growth. More specifically, we consider a homogeneous infection (i.e., initiated by a unique genetic strain) prior to the onset of host-induced selection, where we can assume a random accumulation of mutations. Previously, we have shown that such a model successfully describes about 80\% of sexual HIV-1 transmissions provided the samples are drawn early enough in the infection. Violation of the model is an indicator of either heterogeneous infections or the initiation of selection.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: When the underlying assumptions of our model (homogeneous infection prior to selection and fast exponential growth) are met, we are under a very particular scenario for which we can use a forward approach (instead of backwards in time as provided by coalescent methods). This allows for more computationally efficient methods to derive the time since the most recent common ancestor. Furthermore, the tool performs statistical tests on the Hamming distance frequency distribution, and outputs summary statistics (mean of the best fitting Poisson distribution, goodness of fit p-value, etc). The tool runs within minutes and can readily accommodate the tens of thousands of sequences generated through new ultradeep pyrosequencing technologies. The tool is available on the LANL website.},

This review provides an overview of recent work on HIV risks and networks, with a focus on recent findings in heterosexual network dynamics.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRECENT FINDINGS: Qualitative (ethnographic) assessments have demonstrated the heterogeneity and complexity of heterosexual connections, particularly in Africa, where tradition, official polygamy, and unofficial multiperson arrangements have lead to concurrency of sexual partnerships. A large, quantitative study on Likoma Island, Malawi, demonstrated the considerable, interlocking sexual connections that arise from a high-concurrency sexual setting, even with a low average number of partnerships (low degree) of long duration. Such settings, as suggested by ethnographic studies, may be common in Africa and, coupled with newer information about transmissibility during acute and early infection, may provide a plausible explanation for endemic transmission and possibly for rapid HIV propagation.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nSUMMARY: Recognition of high-concurrency, low-degree networks is an important development for understanding HIV transmission dynamics. Their relevance to heterosexual transmission, and possible extension to other epidemiologic settings, reinforces the heterogeneity and complexity of HIV transmission dynamics.},

	abstract = {The Gippsland Basin has been Australia's main hydrocarbon producing province since the mid-1960's, yet many questions remain concerning the basin's evolution. Interpretation and depth conversion of more than 4,000 km of 2D regional seismic, including generation of 15 regional horizon maps from Palaeozoic to Late Tertiary has allowed development of a 3D structural model for the offshore Gippsland Basin and the deep-water Bass Canyon region. To quantify extension, regional 2D depth sections were generated from the model then back-stripped, balanced and restored. The main results are: - The first rift phase resulted in at least 30\% crustal extension and formed an extensive system of grabens and half-grabens comprising the Central Deep, connected to branching rifts across the present-day Northern Strzelecki Terrace, and eastwards towards the Gippsland Rise. - The second rift phase was focused in the eastern Central Deep, Eastern Graben and Southern Graben resulting in at least 5\% extension, which obliquely reactivated the earlier fault networks of the first rift phase. - Continued post-rift subsidence from the Campanian to Recent has been focused over the reactivated depocentres of the second rift phase. The interplay between ongoing subsidence, carbonate deposition and strong erosional events resulted in the present-day configuration of the Gippsland Amphitheatre and Bass Canyon. - The complex evolution of the basin, characterised by reactivation and repeated post-rift subsidence has overprinted any remnant deep-basin forming detachment. - Based on the structural style of the modelled Strzelecki rift, in areas that are better resolved by seismic, the deep basin structure beneath the Central Deep is anticipated to comprise a similar ENE-WSW trending network of basement highs and tilted half-grabens.},

In physics, networks have been characterized as "scale-free" if they follow a power law with an exponent between 2 and 3. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to test statistically whether distributions of numbers of sexual partners reported from different populations are well described by power laws. STUDY DESIGN: Power laws and an exponential null model are fitted by maximum likelihood techniques to reported distributions of numbers of partners. Data are taken from 4 population-based surveys, 3 from Britain and 1 from rural Zimbabwe. RESULTS: The networks can be described by power laws over a number of orders of magnitude. In addition, the derived exponents differ significantly and meaningfully, with an "accelerating network" formed between men who have sex with men (MSM). CONCLUSIONS: A scale-free network approach provides a reasonable description of distributions of reported numbers of sexual partners.},

Although fragment insertion methods do exist, those methods have not been tested for sOTUs from high-throughput amplicon studies in insertions against a broad reference phylogeny. We benchmarked the SATé-enabled phylogenetic placement (SEPP) technique explicitly against 16S V4 sequence fragments and showed that it outperforms the conceptually problematic but often-used practice of reconstructing de novo phylogenies.

Speciation events that simultaneously create more than two descendants, thereby creating polytomies in the phylogeny, are possible. Moreover, the inability to resolve relationships is often shown as a (soft) polytomy. Both types of polytomies have been traditionally studied in the context of gene tree reconstruction from sequence data. However, polytomies in the species tree cannot be detected or ruled out without considering gene tree discordance. In this paper, we describe a statistical test based on properties of the multi-species coalescent model to test the null hypothesis that a branch in an estimated species tree should be replaced by a polytomy. On both simulated and biological datasets, we show that the null hypothesis is rejected for all but the shortest branches, and in most cases, it is retained for true polytomies. The test, available as part of the Accurate Species TRee ALgorithm (ASTRAL) package, can help systematists decide whether their datasets are sufficient to resolve specific relationships of interest.},

Biol. 9:687-705, 2002), we introduced a new "balanced" minimum evolution (BME) principle, based on a branch length estimation scheme of Y. Pauplin (J. Mol. Evol. 51:41-47, 2000). Initial simulations suggested that FASTME, our program implementing the BME principle, was more accurate than or equivalent to all other distance methods we tested, with running time significantly faster than Neighbor-Joining (NJ). This article further explores the properties of the BME principle, and it explains and illustrates its impressive topological accuracy. We prove that the BME principle is a special case of the weighted least-squares approach, with biologically meaningful variances of the distance estimates. We show that the BME principle is statistically consistent. We demonstrate that FASTME only produces trees with positive branch lengths, a feature that separates this approach from NJ (and related methods) that may produce trees with branches with biologically meaningless negative lengths. Finally, we consider a large simulated data set, with 5,000 100-taxon trees generated by the Aldous beta-splitting distribution encompassing a range of distributions from Yule-Harding to uniform, and using a covarion-like model of sequence evolution. FASTME produces trees faster than NJ, and much faster than WEIGHBOR and the weighted least-squares implementation of PAUP*. Moreover, FASTME trees are consistently more accurate at all settings, ranging from Yule-Harding to uniform distributions, and all ranges of maximum pairwise divergence and departure from molecular clock. Interestingly, the covarion parameter has little effect on the tree quality for any of the algorithms. FASTME is freely available on the web.},

Furthermore, while concatenation, a traditional approach to tree estimation, has excellent performance under many conditions, the expectation is that the best accuracy will be obtained through the use of species tree estimation methods that are specifically designed to address gene tree discordance. In this article, we report on a study to evaluate MP-EST—one of the most popular species tree estimation methods designed to address ILS—as well as concatenation under maximum likelihood, the greedy consensus, and two supertree methods (Matrix Representation with Parsimony and Matrix Representation with Likelihood). Our study shows that several factors impact the absolute and relative accuracy of methods, including the number of gene trees, the accuracy of the estimated gene trees, and the amount of ILS. Concatenation can be more accurate than the best summary methods in some cases (mostly when the gene trees have poor phylogenetic signal or when the level of ILS is low), but summary methods are generally more accurate than concatenation when there are an adequate number of sufficiently accurate gene trees. Our study suggests that coalescent-based species tree methods may be key to estimating highly accurate species trees from multiple loci.},

	abstract = {DNA barcoding has had a major impact on biodiversity science. The elegant simplicity of establishing massive scale databases for a few barcode loci is continuing to change our understanding of species diversity patterns, and continues to enhance human abilities to distinguish among species. Capitalising on the developments of next generation sequencing technologies and decreasing costs of genome sequencing, there is now the opportunity for the DNA barcoding concept to be extended to new kinds of genomic data. We illustrate the benefits and capacity to do this, and also note the constraints and barriers to overcome before it is truly scalable. We advocate a twin track approach: (i) continuation and acceleration of global efforts to build the DNA barcode reference library of life on earth using standard DNA barcodes, and (ii) active development and application of extended DNA barcodes using genome skimming to augment the standard barcoding approach.

	abstract = {It is well known that a phylogenetic tree (gene tree) constructed from DNA sequences for a genetic locus does not necessarily agree with the tree that represents the actual evolutionary pathway of the species involved (species tree). One of the important factors that cause this difference is genetic polymorphism in the ancestral species. Under the assumption of neutral mutations, this problem can be studied by evaluating the probability (P) that a gene tree has the same topology as that of the species tree. When one gene (allele) is used from each of the species involved, the probability can be expressed as a simple function of Ti = ti/(2N), where ti is the evolutionary time measured in generations for the ith internodal branch of the species tree and N is the effective population size. When any of the Ti's is less than 1, the probability P becomes considerably less than 1.0. This probability cannot be substantially increased by increasing the number of alleles sampled from a locus. To increase the probability, one has to use DNA sequences from many different loci that have evolved independently of each other.},

These methods take pairs of sequences, and from them construct a value that, in expectation, is additive under a stochastic model of site substitution. Most models assume a distribution of rates across sites, often based on a gamma distribution. Provided the (shape) parameter of this distribution is known, the method can correctly reconstruct the tree. However, if the shape parameter is not known then we show that topologically different trees, with different shape parameters and associated positive branch lengths, can lead to exactly matching distributions on pairwise site patterns between all pairs of taxa. Thus, one could not distinguish between the two trees using pairs of sequences without some prior knowledge of the shape parameter. More surprisingly, this can happen for any choice of distinct shape parameters on the two trees, and thus the result is not peculiar to a particular or contrived selection of the shape parameters. On a positive note, we point out known conditions where identifiability can be restored (namely, when the branch lengths are clocklike, or if methods such as maximum likelihood are used). © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The standard methods for attempting to deal with this problem treat the objective function as fixed and employ stochastic minimization approaches in the hope of randomly jumping out of local minima. This article suggests a simple trick for performing such minimizations that can be employed in conjunction with most conventional nonstochastic fitting methods. The trick is to stochastically perturb the objective function by bootstrapping the data to be fit. Each bootstrap objective shares the large-scale structure of the original objective but has different small-scale structure. Minimizations of bootstrap objective functions are alternated with minimizations of the original objective function starting from the parameter values with which minimization of the previous bootstrap objective terminated. An example is presented, fitting a nonlinear population dynamic model to population dynamic data and including a comparison of the suggested method with simulated annealing. Convergence diagnostics are discussed.},

	abstract = {Because biological processes can result in different loci having different evolutionary histories, species tree estimation requires multiple loci from across multiple genomes. While many processes can result in discord between gene trees and species trees, incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), modeled by the multi-species coalescent, is considered to be a dominant cause for gene tree heterogeneity. Coalescent-based methods have been developed to estimate species trees, many of which operate by combining estimated gene trees, and so are called "summary methods". Because summary methods are generally fast (and much faster than more complicated coalescent-based methods that co-estimate gene trees and species trees), they have become very popular techniques for estimating species trees from multiple loci. However, recent studies have established that summary methods can have reduced accuracy in the presence of gene tree estimation error, and also that many biological datasets have substantial gene tree estimation error, so that summary methods may not be highly accurate in biologically realistic conditions. Mirarab et al. (Science 2014) presented the "statistical binning" technique to improve gene tree estimation in multi-locus analyses, and showed that it improved the accuracy of MP-EST, one of the most popular coalescent-based summary methods. Statistical binning, which uses a simple heuristic to evaluate "combinability" and then uses the larger sets of genes to re-calculate gene trees, has good empirical performance, but using statistical binning within a phylogenomic pipeline does not have the desirable property of being statistically consistent. We show that weighting the re-calculated gene trees by the bin sizes makes statistical binning statistically consistent under the multispecies coalescent, and maintains the good empirical performance. Thus, "weighted statistical binning" enables highly accurate genome-scale species tree estimation, and is also statistically consistent under the multi-species coalescent model.

New species delimitation methods (SDMs) can accommodate nonmonophyletic species and gene tree discordance as a result of incomplete lineage sorting via the coalescent model, but do not explicitly accommodate gene flow after divergence. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) can incorporate gene flow and estimate other relevant parameters of the speciation process while testing alternative species delimitation hypotheses. We evaluated the accuracy of BPP, SpeDeSTEM, and ABC for delimiting species using simulated data and applied these methods to empirical data from lizards of the Liolaemus darwinii complex. Overall, BPP was the most accurate, ABC showed an intermediate accuracy, and SpeDeSTEM was the least accurate under most simulated conditions. All three SDMs showed lower accuracy when speciation occurred despite gene flow, as found in previous studies, but ABC was the method with the smallest decrease in accuracy. All three SDMs consistently supported the distinctness of southern and northern lineages within L. darwinii. These SDMs based on genetic data should be complemented with novel SDMs based on morphological and ecological data to achieve truly integrative and statistically robust approaches to species discovery.},

Here we use a Bayesian modeling approach to generate the posterior probabilities of species assignments taking account of uncertainties due to unknown gene trees and the ancestral coalescent process. For tractability, we rely on a user-specified guide tree to avoid integrating over all possible species delimitations. The statistical performance of the method is examined using simulations, and the method is illustrated by analyzing sequence data from rotifers, fence lizards, and human populations.},

	abstract = {All persons newly diagnosed with HIV in New York City are offered linkage to care and notification, testing, and referrals of named partners, and, more recently, " partners " with highly similar pol sequences who are viremic or out of care. The ability to use routinely reported genotype data to target rapidly growing clusters of genetically linked persons has the potential to improve outcomes in hyperendemic populations. It has been suggested that genetic clusters may be a sampling artifact and not reflect underlying growth dynamics. If true, there would be little or no benefit from targeting services to clusters. To address this question, we tested whether past cluster growth predicts future cluster growth. We compared the ability of various targeting strategies to predict cluster growth between 2008 and 2015 in NYC: network‐ informed strategies (i.e., total and proportional cluster growth and machine learning incorporating demographic variables) versus two network‐naïve approaches (random selection and selection based on the presence of recent cases). We inferred an HIV‐1 transmission network using baseline genotypes from 63,942 individuals in the NYC HIV Surveillance Registry using HIV‐TRACE, which computes genetic distance between sequences and identifies those that are sufficiently close to imply direct or indirect epidemiologic linkage. This network contained 3415 clusters of two or more persons and represented 21.3\% of records (13,633/63,942). Network‐informed targeting strategies predicted an order of magnitude more new cases than network‐ naïve approaches: clusters with the greatest growth proportional to the square root of cluster size grew, on average, by 25.9 new diagnoses per 100 cases in the following year, compared with random cluster selection (2.1 new diagnoses) or selection of only clusters with recent diagnoses (8.5 new diagnoses). Machine learning approaches performed comparably to growth‐based schemes, suggesting that—after accounting for growth—demography does not substantially improve predictions. These findings suggest that network‐based prediction of cluster growth may be a useful tool for directing services aimed at reducing HIV transmission.},

Recent developments in molecular phylodynamics have provided new routes to obtain these parameter estimates, and current clinical practice provides suitable data for entire infected populations. METHODS: A phylodynamic analysis was performed on partial pol gene sequences obtained for routine clinical care from 14,560 individuals, representing approximately 60\% of the HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) under care in the United Kingdom. RESULTS: Among individuals linked to others in the data set, 29\% are linked to only 1 individual, 41\% are linked to 2-10 individuals, and 29\% are linked to {\textgreater}/=10 individuals. The right-skewed degree distribution can be approximated by a power law, but the data are best fitted by a Waring distribution for all time depths. For time depths of 5-7 years, the distribution parameter rho lies within the range that indicates infinite variance. CONCLUSIONS: The transmission network among UK MSM is characterized by preferential association such that a randomly distributed intervention would not be expected to stop the epidemic.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Accurate identification of orthologs is crucial for evolutionary studies and for functional annotation. Several algorithms have been developed for ortholog delineation, but so far, manually curated genome-scale biological databases of orthologous genes for algorithm evaluation have been lacking. We evaluated four popular ortholog prediction algorithms (MultiParanoid; and OrthoMCL; RBH: Reciprocal Best Hit; RSD: Reciprocal Smallest Distance; the last two extended into clustering algorithms cRBH and cRSD, respectively, so that they can predict orthologs across multiple taxa) against a set of 2,723 groups of high-quality curated orthologs from 6 Saccharomycete yeasts in the Yeast Gene Order Browser. RESULTS Examination of sensitivity [TP/(TP+FN)], specificity [TN/(TN+FP)], and accuracy [(TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)] across a broad parameter range showed that cRBH was the most accurate and specific algorithm, whereas OrthoMCL was the most sensitive. Evaluation of the algorithms across a varying number of species showed that cRBH had the highest accuracy and lowest false discovery rate [FP/(FP+TP)], followed by cRSD. Of the six species in our set, three descended from an ancestor that underwent whole genome duplication. Subsequent differential duplicate loss events in the three descendants resulted in distinct classes of gene loss patterns, including cases where the genes retained in the three descendants are paralogs, constituting 'traps' for ortholog prediction algorithms. We found that the false discovery rate of all algorithms dramatically increased in these traps. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that simple algorithms, like cRBH, may be better ortholog predictors than more complex ones (e.g., OrthoMCL and MultiParanoid) for evolutionary and functional genomics studies where the objective is the accurate inference of single-copy orthologs (e.g., molecular phylogenetics), but that all algorithms fail to accurately predict orthologs when paralogy is rampant.},

	abstract = {We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to map raw pixels from a single front-facing camera directly to steering commands. This end-to-end approach proved surprisingly powerful. With minimum training data from humans the system learns to drive in traffic on local roads with or without lane markings and on highways. It also operates in areas with unclear visual guidance such as in parking lots and on unpaved roads. The system automatically learns internal representations of the necessary processing steps such as detecting useful road features with only the human steering angle as the training signal. We never explicitly trained it to detect, for example, the outline of roads. Compared to explicit decomposition of the problem, such as lane marking detection, path planning, and control, our end-to-end system optimizes all processing steps simultaneously. We argue that this will eventually lead to better performance and smaller systems. Better performance will result because the internal components self-optimize to maximize overall system performance, instead of optimizing human-selected intermediate criteria, e.g., lane detection. Such criteria understandably are selected for ease of human interpretation which doesn't automatically guarantee maximum system performance. Smaller networks are possible because the system learns to solve the problem with the minimal number of processing steps. We used an NVIDIA DevBox and Torch 7 for training and an NVIDIA DRIVE(TM) PX self-driving car computer also running Torch 7 for determining where to drive. The system operates at 30 frames per second (FPS).},

These guide trees are often the limiting factor in making large alignments, and considerable effort has been expended over the years in making these quickly or accurately. In this article we show that, at least for protein families with large numbers of sequences that can be benchmarked with known structures, simple chained guide trees give the most accurate alignments. These also happen to be the fastest and simplest guide trees to construct, computationally. Such guide trees have a striking effect on the accuracy of alignments produced by some of the most widely used alignment packages. There is a marked increase in accuracy and a marked decrease in computational time, once the number of sequences goes much above a few hundred. This is true, even if the order of sequences in the guide tree is random.},

	abstract = {BEP clade of the grass family (Poaceae) is composed of three subfamilies, i.e. Bambusoideae, Ehrhartoideae, and Pooideae. Controversies on the phylogenetic relationships among three subfamilies still persist in spite of great efforts. However, previous evidence was mainly provided from plastid genes with only a few nuclear genes utilized. Given different evolutionary histories recorded by plastid and nuclear genes, it is indispensable to uncover their relationships based on nuclear genes. Here, eleven species with whole-sequenced genome and six species with transcriptomic data were included in this study. A total of 121 one-to-one orthologous groups (OGs) were identified and phylogenetic trees were reconstructed by different tree-building methods. Genes which might have undergone positive selection and played important roles in adaptive evolution were also investigated from 314 and 173 one-to-one OGs in two bamboo species and 14 grass species, respectively. Our results support the ((B, P) E) topology with high supporting values. Besides, our findings also indicate that 24 and nine orthologs with statistically significant evidence of positive selection are mainly involved in abiotic and biotic stress response, reproduction and development, plant metabolism and enzyme etc. from two bamboo species and 14 grass species, respectively. In summary, this study demonstrates the power of phylogenomic approach to shed lights on the evolutionary relationships within the BEP clade, and offers valuable insights into adaptive evolution of the grass family.},

	abstract = {With recent advances in genomic sequencing, the importance of taking the effects of the processes that can cause discord between the speciation history and the individual gene histories into account has become evident. For multilocus datasets, it is difficult toachieve complete coverage of all sampled loci across all sample specimens, a problem that also arises when combining incompletely overlapping datasets. Here we examine how missing data affects the accuracy of species tree reconstruction. In our study, 10- and 100-locus sequence datasets were simulated under the coalescent model from shallow and deep speciation histories, and species trees were estimated using the maximum likelihood and Bayesian frameworks (with STEM and *BEAST, respectively). The accuracy of the estimated species trees was evaluated using the symmetric difference and the SPR distance. We examine the effects of sampling more than one individual per species, as well as the effects of different patterns of missing data (i.e., different amounts of missing data, which is represented among random taxa as opposed to being concentrated in specific taxa, as is often the case for empirical studies). Our general conclusion is that the species tree estimates are remarkably resilient to the effects of missing data. We find that for datasets with more limited numbers of loci, sampling more than one individual per species has the strongest effect on improving species tree accuracy when there is missing data, especially at higher degrees of missing data. For larger multilocus datasets (e.g., 25-100loci), the amount of missing data has a negligible effect on species tree reconstruction, even at 50\% missing data and a single sampled individual per species. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {All inferences in comparative biology depend on accurate estimates of evolutionary relationships. Recent phylogenetic analyses have turned away from maximum parsimony towards the probabilistic techniques of maximum likelihood and bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC). These probabilistic techniques represent a parametric approach to statistical phylogenetics, because their criterion for evaluating a topology--the probability of the data, given the tree--is calculated with reference to an explicit evolutionary model from which the data are assumed to be identically distributed. Maximum parsimony can be considered nonparametric, because trees are evaluated on the basis of a general metric--the minimum number of character state changes required to generate the data on a given tree--without assuming a specific distribution. The shift to parametric methods was spurred, in large part, by studies showing that although both approaches perform well most of the time, maximum parsimony is strongly biased towards recovering an incorrect tree under certain combinations of branch lengths, whereas maximum likelihood is not. All these evaluations simulated sequences by a largely homogeneous evolutionary process in which data are identically distributed. There is ample evidence, however, that real-world gene sequences evolve heterogeneously and are not identically distributed. Here we show that maximum likelihood and BMCMC can become strongly biased and statistically inconsistent when the rates at which sequence sites evolve change non-identically over time. Maximum parsimony performs substantially better than current parametric methods over a wide range of conditions tested, including moderate heterogeneity and phylogenetic problems not normally considered difficult.},

We study sorting of signed permutations by reversals, a problem that adequately models rearrangements in a small genomes like chloroplast or mitochondrial DNA. The previously suggested approximation algorithms for sorting signed permutations by reversals compute the reversal distance between permutations with an astonishing accuracy for both simulated and biological data.

In such cases the missing data are non-randomly distributed and usually present in all partitions (i.e. groups of characters) sampled. Parametric methods often provide greater resolution and support than parsimony in such cases, yet this may be caused by extrapolation of branch lengths from one partition to another. In this study I use contrived and simulated examples to demonstrate that likelihood, even when applied to simple matrices with little or no homoplasy, homogeneous evolution across groups of characters, perfect model fit, and hundreds or thousands of variable characters, can provide strong support for incorrect topologies when the matrices have non-random distributions of missing data distributed across all partitions. I do so using a systematic exploration of alternative seven-taxon tree topologies and distributions of missing data in two partitions to demonstrate that these likelihood-based artefacts may occur frequently and are not shared by parsimony. I also demonstrate that Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis is more robust to these artefacts than is likelihood. © The Willi Hennig Society 2011.},

	abstract = {Decreasing the number of people who must be vaccinated to immunize a community against an infectious disease could both save resources and decrease outbreak sizes. A key to reaching such a lower threshold of immunization is to find and vaccinate people who, through their behavior, are more likely than average to become infected and to spread the disease further. Fortunately, the very behavior that makes these people important to vaccinate can help us to localize them. Earlier studies have shown that one can use previous contacts to find people that are central in static contact networks. However, real contact patterns are not static. In this paper, we investigate if there is additional information in the temporal contact structure for vaccination protocols to exploit. We answer this affirmative by proposing two immunization methods that exploit temporal correlations and showing that these methods outperform a benchmark static-network protocol in four empirical contact datasets under various epidemic scenarios. Both methods rely only on obtainable, local information, and can be implemented in practice. For the datasets directly related to contact patterns of potential disease spreading (of sexually-transmitted and nosocomial infections respectively), the most efficient protocol is to sample people at random and vaccinate their latest contacts. The network datasets are temporal, which enables us to make more realistic evaluations than earlier studies--we use only information about the past for the purpose of vaccination, and about the future to simulate disease outbreaks. Using analytically tractable models, we identify two temporal structures that explain how the protocols earn their efficiency in the empirical data. This paper is a first step towards real vaccination protocols that exploit temporal-network structure--future work is needed both to characterize the structure of real contact sequences and to devise immunization methods that exploit these.},

These trees might not be fully resolved but there is strong combinatorial evidence for each proposed edge.

	abstract = {Metagenomics is the study of the genomic content of a sample of organisms obtained from a common habitat using targeted or random sequencing. Goals include understanding the extent and role of microbial diversity. The taxonomical content of such a sample is usually estimated by comparison against sequence databases of known sequences. Most published studies use the analysis of paired-end reads, complete sequences of environmental fosmid and BAC clones, or environmental assemblies. Emerging sequencing-by-synthesis technologies with very high throughput are paving the way to low-cost random “shotgun” approaches. This paper introduces MEGAN, a new computer program that allows laptop analysis of large metagenomic data sets. In a preprocessing step, the set of DNA sequences is compared against databases of known sequences using BLAST or another comparison tool. MEGAN is then used to compute and explore the taxonomical content of the data set, employing the NCBI taxonomy to summarize and order the results. A simple lowest common ancestor algorithm assigns reads to taxa such that the taxonomical level of the assigned taxon reflects the level of conservation of the sequence. The software allows large data sets to be dissected without the need for assembly or the targeting of specific phylogenetic markers. It provides graphical and statistical output for comparing different data sets. The approach is applied to several data sets, including the Sargasso Sea data set, a recently published metagenomic data set sampled from a mammoth bone, and several complete microbial genomes. Also, simulations that evaluate the performance of the approach for different read lengths are presented.},

However, sequence production alone is not enough to generate a high quality reference genome, and in many cases, poor planning can lead to extremely fragmented genome assemblies preventing high quality gene annotation and other desired analyses. Insect genomes can be problematic to assemble, due to combinations of high polymorphism, inability to breed for genome homozygocity, and small physical sizes limiting the quantity of DNA able to be isolated from a single individual. Recent advances in sequencing technology and assembly strategies are enabling a revolution for insect genome reference sequencing and assembly. Here we review historical and new genome sequencing and assembly strategies, with a particular focus on their application to arthropod genomes. We highlight both the need to design sequencing strategies for the requirements of the assembly software, and new long-read technologies that are enabling a return to traditional assembly approaches. Finally, we compare and contrast very cost effective short read draft genome strategies with the long read approaches that although entailing additional cost, bring a higher likelihood of success and the possibility of archival assembly qualities approaching that of finished genomes.},

Prevention efforts might reduce HIV incidence but are unlikely to eliminate this disease. We investigated a theoretical strategy of universal voluntary HIV testing and immediate treatment with ART, and examined the conditions under which the HIV epidemic could be driven towards elimination. Methods: We used mathematical models to explore the effect on the case reproduction number (stochastic model) and long-term dynamics of the HIV epidemic (deterministic transmission model) of testing all people in our test-case community (aged 15 years and older) for HIV every year and starting people on ART immediately after they are diagnosed HIV positive. We used data from South Africa as the test case for a generalised epidemic, and assumed that all HIV transmission was heterosexual. Findings: The studied strategy could greatly accelerate the transition from the present endemic phase, in which most adults living with HIV are not receiving ART, to an elimination phase, in which most are on ART, within 5 years. It could reduce HIV incidence and mortality to less than one case per 1000 people per year by 2016, or within 10 years of full implementation of the strategy, and reduce the prevalence of HIV to less than 1\% within 50 years. We estimate that in 2032, the yearly cost of the present strategy and the theoretical strategy would both be US\$1·7 billion; however, after this time, the cost of the present strategy would continue to increase whereas that of the theoretical strategy would decrease. Interpretation: Universal voluntary HIV testing and immediate ART, combined with present prevention approaches, could have a major effect on severe generalised HIV/AIDS epidemics. This approach merits further mathematical modelling, research, and broad consultation. Funding: None. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phylogenetic birth-death models are opening a new window on the processes of genome evolution in studies of the evolution of gene and protein families, protein-protein interaction networks, microRNAs, and copy number variation. Given a species tree and a set of genomic characters in present-day species, the birth-death approach estimates the most likely rates required to explain the observed data and returns the expected ancestral character states and the history of character state changes. Achieving a balance between model complexity and generalizability is a fundamental challenge in the application of birth-death models. While more parameters promise greater accuracy and more biologically realistic models, increasing model complexity can lead to overfitting and a heavy computational cost.

RESULTS: Here we present a systematic, empirical investigation of these tradeoffs, using protein domain families in six metazoan genomes as a case study. We compared models of increasing complexity, implemented in the Count program, with respect to model fit, robustness, and stability. In addition, we used a bootstrapping procedure to assess estimator variability. The results show that the most complex model, which allows for both branch-specific and family-specific rate variation, achieves the best fit, without overfitting. Variance remains low with increasing complexity, except for family-specific loss rates. This variance is reduced when the number of discrete rate categories is increased.

CONCLUSIONS: The work presented here evaluates model choice for genomic birth-death models in a systematic way and presents the first use of bootstrapping to assess estimator variance in birth-death models. We find that a model incorporating both lineage and family rate variation yields more accurate estimators without sacrificing generality. Our results indicate that model choice can lead to fundamentally different evolutionary conclusions, emphasizing the importance of more biologically realistic and complex models.},

We have sequenced seven nuclear housekeeping genes from 17 new sponges, bringing the total to 29 species analyzed, including multiple representatives of the Demospongiae, Calcarea, Hexactinellida, and Homoscleromorpha, and analyzed a data set also including six nonmetazoan outgroups and 36 eumetazoans using a variety of phylogenetic methods and evolutionary models. We used leaf stability to identify rogue taxa and investigate their effect on the support of the nodes in our trees, and we identified clades most likely to represent phylogenetic artifacts through the comparison of trees derived using different methods (and models) and through site-stripping analyses. Further, we investigated compositional heterogeneity and tested whether amino acid composition bias affected our results. Finally, we used Bayes factors to compare our results against previously published phylogenies. All our maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian analyses find sponges to be paraphyletic, with all analyses finding three extant paraphyletic sponge lineages, Demospongiae plus Hexactinellida, Calcarea, and Homoscleromorpha. All but one of our ML and Bayesian analyses support the monophyly of Eumetazoa (here Cnidaria + Bilateria) and a sister group relationship between Placozoa (here Trichoplax adhaerens) and Eumetazoa. Bayes factors invariably provide decisive support in favor of poriferan paraphyly when compared against either a sister group relationship between Porifera and Cnidaria or with a monophyletic Porifera with respect to a monophyletic Eumetazoa. Although we were able to recover sponge monophyly using our data set, this was only possible under unrealistic evolutionary models, if poorly performing phylogenetic methods were used, or in situations where the potential for the generation of tree reconstruction artifacts was artificially exacerbated. Everything considered, our data set does not provide any support for a monophyletic Diploblastica (here Placozoa + Cnidaria + Porifera) and suggests that a monophyletic Porifera may be better seen as a phylogenetic artifact.},

	abstract = {HIV was transmitted from apes to humans multiple times before the virus began to spread among humans some time in the early 20th century. The virus is now found around the globe and has evolved into several different subtypes. Also, HIV continues to evolve inside each infected individual so that different variations of the virus are often present in the same person at any given time. When a person initially becomes infected, immune cells called killer T-cells seek out and destroy infected cells. However, HIV quickly acquires genetic mutations that allow it to escape the immune system and multiply in the body. There is a cost to this evasion strategy: the mutant forms of the virus often don’t multiply as rapidly as the variant that first infected the individual. This may explain why the virus often mutates back to its previous form in newly infected people. But many questions remain about how these pressures influence the evolution of the virus in individuals and in populations over time. Now, Zanini et al. have sequenced the genomes of HIV samples collected from nine people with HIV in Sweden over the course of five to eight years. These individuals were diagnosed between 1990 and 2003 – when HIV medications were not as widely used as they are now – and did not receive any treatment during the course of the study. Therefore, the study provides a rare opportunity to look at how HIV evolves in the absence of drugs that target the virus. Zanini et al. sequenced the entire genetic code of each form of the virus identified in the samples. The data show that HIV follows predictable patterns of evolution within individuals as well as across human populations. Mutations happen frequently all over the HIV genome. However, the mutant viruses often revert to a common or “optimal” form of the virus throughout the course of infection. This suggests that there is a tradeoff between the benefits of acquiring new mutations and maintaining a set of traits that have enabled the virus to spread so successfully in humans. To make it easier for other researchers to explore the data, Zanini et al. created a web application that allows others to access and create visual representations of viral evolution. Together these findings suggest that it will be possible to achieve a fuller understanding of RNA virus evolution that integrates the molecular biology of the virus and the immune response of the host with the evolutionary changes.},

	abstract = {Accurate phylogenetic reconstruction methods are currently limited to a maximum of few dozens of taxa. Supertree methods construct a large tree over a large set of taxa, from a set of small trees over overlapping subsets of the complete taxa set. Hence, in order to construct the tree of life over a million and a half different species, the use of a supertree method over the product of accurate methods, is inevitable. Perhaps the simplest version of this task that is still widely applicable, yet quite challenging, is quartet-based reconstruction. This problem lies at the root of many tree reconstruction methods and theoretical as well as experimental results have been reported. Nevertheless, dealing with false, conflicting quartet trees remains problematic. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for constructing a tree from a set of input quartet trees even with a significant fraction of errors. We show empirically that conflicts in the inputs are handled satisfactorily and that it significantly outperforms and outraces the Matrix Representation with Parsimony (MRP) methods that have previously been most successful in dealing with supertrees. Our algorithm is based on a divide and conquer algorithm where our divide step uses a semidefinite programming (SDP) formulation of MaxCut. We remark that this builds on previous work of ours for piecing together trees from rooted triplet trees. The recursion for unrooted quartets, however, is more complicated in that even with completely consistent set of quartet trees the problem is NP-hard, as opposed to the problem for triples where there is a linear time algorithm. This complexity leads to several issues and some solutions of possible independent interest.},

	abstract = {Many research groups are estimating trees containing anywhere from a few thousands to hundreds of thousands of species, toward the eventual goal of the estimation of a Tree of Life, containing perhaps as many as several million leaves. These phylogenetic estimations present enormous computational challenges, and current computational methods are likely to fail to run even on data sets in the low end of this range. One approach to estimate a large species tree is to use phylogenetic estimation methods (such as maximum likelihood) on a supermatrix produced by concatenating multiple sequence alignments for a collection of markers; however, the most accurate of these phylogenetic estimation methods are extremely computationally intensive for data sets with more than a few thousand sequences. Supertree methods, which assemble phylogenetic trees from a collection of trees on subsets of the taxa, are important tools for phylogeny estimation where phylogenetic analyses based upon maximum likelihood (ML) are infeasible. In this paper, we introduce SuperFine, a meta-method that utilizes a novel two-step procedure in order to improve the accuracy and scalability of supertree methods. Our study, using both simulated and empirical data, shows that SuperFine-boosted supertree methods produce more accurate trees than standard supertree methods, and run quickly on very large data sets with thousands of sequences. Furthermore, SuperFine-boosted matrix representation with parsimony (MRP, the most well-known supertree method) approaches the accuracy of ML methods on supermatrix data sets under realistic conditions.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a review and critique of statistical null hypothesis testing in ecological studies in general, and wildlife studies in particular, and describes an alternative. Our review of Ecology and the journal of Wildlife Management found the use of null hypothesis testing to be pervasive. The estimated number of P-values appearing within articles of Ecology exceeded 8,000 in 1991 and has exceeded 3,000 in each year since 1984, whereas the estimated number of P-values in the Journal of Wildlife Management exceeded 8,000 in 1997 and has exceeded 3,000 in each year since 1991. We estimated that 47\% (SE = 3.9\%) of the P-values in the Journal of Wildlife;fe Management lacked estimates of means or effect sizes or even the sign of the difference in means or other parameters. We find that null hypothesis testing is uninformative when no estimates of means or effect size and their precision are given. Contrary to common dogma, tests of statistical null hypotheses have relatively little utility in science and are not a fundamental aspect of the scientific method. We recommend their use be reduced in favor of more informative approaches. Towards this objective, we describe a relatively new paradigm of data analysis based on Kullback-Leibler information. This paradigm is an extension of likelihood theory and, when used correctly, avoids many of the fundamental limitations and common misuses of null hypothesis testing. Information-theoretic methods focus on providing a strength of evidence for an a priori set of alternative hypotheses, rather than a statistical test of a null hypothesis. This paradigm allows the following types of evidence for the alternative hypotheses: the rank of each hypothesis, expressed as a model; an estimate of the formal likelihood of each model, given the data; a measure of precision that incorporates model selection uncertainty; and simple methods to allow the use of the set of alternative models in making formal inference. We provide an example of the information-theoretic approach using data on the effect of lead on survival in spectacled elder ducks (Somateria fischeri). Regardless of the analysis paradigm used, we strongly recommend inferences based on a priori considerations be clearly separated from those resulting from some form of data dredging.},

In the hope of improving our understanding of angiosperm phylogeny, we expanded sampling of taxa and genes beyond previous analyses. • Methods: We conducted two primary analyses based on 640 species representing 330 families. The first included 25260 aligned base pairs (bp) from 17 genes (representing all three plant genomes, i.e., nucleus, plastid, and mitochondrion). The second included 19846 aligned bp from 13 genes (representing only the nucleus and plastid). • Key results: Many important questions of deep-level relationships in the nonmonocot angiosperms have now been resolved with strong support. Amborellaceae, Nymphaeales, and Austrobaileyales are successive sisters to the remaining angiosperms (Mesangiospermae), which are resolved into Chloranthales + Magnoliidae as sister to Monocotyledoneae + [Ceratophyllaceae + Eudicotyledoneae]. Eudicotyledoneae contains a basal grade subtending Gunneridae. Within Gunneridae, Gunnerales are sister to the remainder (Pentapetalae), which comprises (1) Superrosidae, consisting of Rosidae (including Vitaceae) and Saxifragales; and (2) Superasteridae, comprising Berberidopsidales, Santalales, Caryophyllales, Asteridae, and, based on this study, Dilleniaceae (although other recent analyses disagree with this placement). Within the major subclades of Pentapetalae, most deep-level relationships are resolved with strong support. • Conclusions: Our analyses confirm that with large amounts of sequence data, most deep-level relationships within the angiosperms can be resolved. We anticipate that this well-resolved angiosperm tree will be of broad utility for many areas of biology, including physiology, ecology, paleobiology, and genomics.},

	abstract = {Abstract Identifying and monitoring HIV clusters could be useful in tracking the leading edge of HIV transmission in epidemics. Currently, greater specificity in the definition of HIV clusters is needed to reduce confusion in the interpretation of HIV clustering results. We address sampling density as one of the key aspects of HIV cluster analysis. The proportion of viral sequences in clusters was estimated at sampling densities from 1.0\% to 70\%. A set of 1,248 HIV-1C env gp120 V1C5 sequences from a single community in Botswana was utilized in simulation studies. Matching numbers of HIV-1C V1C5 sequences from the LANL HIV Database were used as comparators. HIV clusters were identified by phylogenetic inference under bootstrapped maximum likelihood and pairwise distance cut-offs. Sampling density below 10\% was associated with stochastic HIV clustering with broad confidence intervals. HIV clustering increased linearly at sampling density {\textgreater}10\%, and was accompanied by narrowing confidence intervals. Patterns of HIV clustering were similar at bootstrap thresholds 0.7 to 1.0, but the extent of HIV clustering decreased with higher bootstrap thresholds. The origin of sampling (local concentrated vs. scattered global) had a substantial impact on HIV clustering at sampling densities ≥10\%. Pairwise distances at 10\% were estimated as a threshold for cluster analysis of HIV-1 V1C5 sequences. The node bootstrap support distribution provided additional evidence for 10\% sampling density as the threshold for HIV cluster analysis. The detectability of HIV clusters is substantially affected by sampling density. A minimal genotyping density of 10\% and sampling density of 50-70\% are suggested for HIV-1 V1C5 cluster analysis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Failure to account for covariation patterns in helical regions of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes has the potential to misdirect the estimation of the phylogenetic signal of the data. Furthermore, the extremes of length variation among taxa, combined with regional substitution rate variation can mislead the alignment of rRNA sequences and thus distort subsequent tree reconstructions. However, recent developments in phylogenetic methodology now allow a comprehensive integration of secondary structures in alignment and tree reconstruction analyses based on rRNA sequences, which has been shown to correct some of these problems. Here, we explore the potentials of RNA substitution models and the interactions of specific model setups with the inherent pattern of covariation in rRNA stems and substitution rate variation among loop regions.

RESULTS: We found an explicit impact of RNA substitution models on tree reconstruction analyses. The application of specific RNA models in tree reconstructions is hampered by interaction between the appropriate modelling of covarying sites in stem regions, and excessive homoplasy in some loop regions. RNA models often failed to recover reasonable trees when single-stranded regions are excessively homoplastic, because these regions contribute a greater proportion of the data when covarying sites are essentially downweighted. In this context, the RNA6A model outperformed all other models, including the more parametrized RNA7 and RNA16 models.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results depict a trade-off between increased accuracy in estimation of interdependencies in helical regions with the risk of magnifying positions lacking phylogenetic signal. We can therefore conclude that caution is warranted when applying rRNA covariation models, and suggest that loop regions be independently screened for phylogenetic signal, and eliminated when they are indistinguishable from random noise. In addition to covariation and homoplasy, other factors, like non-stationarity of substitution rates and base compositional heterogeneity, can disrupt the signal of ribosomal RNA data. All these factors dictate sophisticated estimation of evolutionary pattern in rRNA data, just as other molecular data require similarly complicated (but different) corrections.},

	abstract = {Phylogenies are usually dated by calibrating interior nodes against the fossil record. This relies on indirect methods that, in the worst case, misrepresent the fossil information. Here, we contrast such node dating with an approach that includes fossils along with the extant taxa in a Bayesian total-evidence analysis. As a test case, we focus on the early radiation of the Hymenoptera, mostly documented by poorly preserved impression fossils that are difficult to place phylogenetically. Specifically, we compare node dating using nine calibration points derived from the fossil record with total-evidence dating based on 343 morphological characters scored for 45 fossil (4--20 complete) and 68 extant taxa. In both cases we use molecular data from seven markers (∼5 kb) for the extant taxa. Because it is difficult to model speciation, extinction, sampling, and fossil preservation realistically, we develop a simple uniform prior for clock trees with fossils, and we use relaxed clock models to accommodate rate variation across the tree. Despite considerable uncertainty in the placement of most fossils, we find that they contribute significantly to the estimation of divergence times in the total-evidence analysis. In particular, the posterior distributions on divergence times are less sensitive to prior assumptions and tend to be more precise than in node dating. The total-evidence analysis also shows that four of the seven Hymenoptera calibration points used in node dating are likely to be based on erroneous or doubtful assumptions about the fossil placement. With respect to the early radiation of Hymenoptera, our results suggest that the crown group dates back to the Carboniferous, ∼309 Ma (95\% interval: 291--347 Ma), and diversified into major extant lineages much earlier than previously thought, well before the Triassic.

	abstract = {Inferring disease transmission networks is important in epidemiology in order to understand and prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Reconstruction of the infection transmission networks requires insight into viral genome data as well as social interactions. For the HIV-1 epidemic, current research either uses genetic information of patients' virus to infer the past infection events or uses statistics of sexual interactions to model the network structure of viral spreading. Methods for a reliable reconstruction of HIV-1 transmission dynamics, taking into account both molecular and societal data are still lacking. The aim of this study is to combine information from both genetic and epidemiological scales to characterize and analyse a transmission network of the HIV-1 epidemic in central Italy.We introduce a novel filter-reduction method to build a network of HIV infected patients based on their social and treatment information. The network is then combined with a genetic network, to infer a hypothetical infection transmission network. We apply this method to a cohort study of HIV-1 infected patients in central Italy and find that patients who are highly connected in the network have longer untreated infection periods. We also find that the network structures for homosexual males and heterosexual populations are heterogeneous, consisting of a majority of 'peripheral nodes' that have only a few sexual interactions and a minority of 'hub nodes' that have many sexual interactions. Inferring HIV-1 transmission networks using this novel combined approach reveals remarkable correlations between high out-degree individuals and longer untreated infection periods. These findings signify the importance of early treatment and support the potential benefit of wide population screening, management of early diagnoses and anticipated antiretroviral treatment to prevent viral transmission and spread. The approach presented here for reconstructing HIV-1 transmission networks can have important repercussions in the design of intervention strategies for disease control.},

	abstract = {DNA barcoding is a promising approach to the diagnosis of biological diversity in which DNA sequences serve as the primary key for information retrieval. Most existing software for evolutionary analysis of DNA sequences was designed for phylogenetic analyses and, hence, those algorithms do not offer appropriate solutions for the rapid, but precise analyses needed for DNA barcoding, and are also unable to process the often large comparative datasets. We developed a flexible software tool for DNA taxonomy, named TaxI. This program calculates sequence divergences between a query sequence (taxon to be barcoded) and each sequence of a dataset of reference sequences defined by the user. Because the analysis is based on separate pairwise alignments this software is also able to work with sequences characterized by multiple insertions and deletions that are difficult to align in large sequence sets (i.e. thousands of sequences) by multiple alignment algorithms because of computational restrictions. Here, we demonstrate the utility of this approach with two datasets of fish larvae and juveniles from Lake Constance and juvenile land snails under different models of sequence evolution. Sets of ribosomal 16S rRNA sequences, characterized by multiple indels, performed as good as or better than cox1 sequence sets in assigning sequences to species, demonstrating the suitability of rRNA genes for DNA barcoding.},

The purpose of this review is to highlight the current utilities and limitations of phylogenetics in HIV epidemiological research from sample collection through to data analysis. RECENT FINDINGS Studies of HIV phylogenies can provide critical information about HIV epidemics that are otherwise difficult to obtain through traditional study design such as transmission of drug-resistant virus, mixing between demographic groups, and rapidity of viral spread within populations. However, recent results from empirical and theoretical studies of HIV phylogenies challenge some of the key assumptions and interpretations from phylogenetic studies. Recent findings include lack of transmission bottlenecks in MSM and injection drug use epidemics, evidence for preferential transmission of HIV virus in heterosexual epidemics, and limited evidence that tree topologies correlate directly with underlying network structures. Other challenges include a lack of a standardized definition for a phylogenetic transmission cluster and biased or sparse sampling of HIV transmission networks. SUMMARY Phylogenetics is an important tool for HIV research, and offers opportunities to understand critical aspects of the HIV epidemic. Like all epidemiological research, the methods used and interpretation of results from phylogenetic studies should be made cautiously with careful consideration.},

Features are l-mers of amino acids, and each organism is represented by a profile of frequencies of all features. The selection of feature length is critical in the FFP method, and we have developed a procedure for identifying the optimal feature lengths for inferring the phylogeny of prokaryotes, strictly speaking, a proteome phylogeny. Our FFP trees are constructed with whole proteomes of 884 prokaryotes, 16 unicellular eukaryotes, and 2 random sequences. To highlight the branching order of major groups, we present a simplified proteome FFP tree of monophyletic class or phylum with branch support. In our whole-proteome FFP trees (i) Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryota, and a random sequence outgroup are clearly separated; (ii) Archaea and Bacteria form a sister group when rooted with random sequences; (iii) Planctomycetes, which possesses an intracellular membrane compartment, is placed at the basal position of the Bacteria domain; (iv) almost all groups are monophyletic in prokaryotes at most taxonomic levels, but many differences in the branching order of major groups are observed between our proteome FFP tree and trees built with other methods; and (v) previously "unclassified" genomes may be assigned to the most likely taxa. We describe notable similarities and differences between our FFP trees and those based on other methods in grouping and phylogeny of prokaryotes.},

Great apes in particular exhibit variation of evolutionary patterns along their genomes. However, the great ape data also bring new challenges, such as the presence of incomplete lineage sorting and ancestral shared polymorphisms. Previous methods for genome-scale analysis are restricted to very few individuals or cannot disentangle the contribution of mutation rates and fixation biases. This represents a limitation both for the understanding of these forces as well as for the detection of regions affected by selection. Here, we present a new model designed to estimate mutation rates and fixation biases from genetic variation within and between species. We relax the assumption of instantaneous substitutions, modeling substitutions as mutational events followed by a gradual fixation. Hence, we straightforwardly account for shared ancestral polymorphisms and incomplete lineage sorting. We analyze genome-wide synonymous site alignments of human, chimpanzee, and two orangutan species. From each taxon, we include data from several individuals. We estimate mutation rates and GC-biased gene conversion intensity. We find that both mutation rates and biased gene conversion vary with GC content. We also find lineage-specific differences, with weaker fixation biases in orangutan species, suggesting a reduced historical effective population size. Finally, our results are consistent with directional selection acting on coding sequences in relation to exonic splicing enhancers.},

An alternate rooting method is the midpoint rooting (MPR). In this case, the root is set at the midpoint between the two most divergent operational taxonomic units. Although the midpoint rooting algorithm has been extensively used, the efficiency of this method in retrieving the correct root remains untested. In the present study, we empirically tested the success rate of the MPR in obtaining the outgroup root for a given phylogenetic tree. This was carried out by eliminating outgroups in 50 selected data sets from 33 papers and rooting the trees with the midpoint method. We were thus able to compare the root position retrieved by each method. Data sets were separated into three categories with different root consistencies: data sets with a single outgroup taxon (54\% success rate for MPR), data sets with multiple outgroup taxa that showed inconsistency in root position (82\% success rate), and data sets with multiple outgroup taxa in which root position was consistent (94\% success rate). Interestingly, the more consistent the outgroup root is, the more successful MPR appears to be. This is a strong indication that the MPR method is valuable, particularly for cases where a proper outgroup is unavailable.},

	abstract = {Ray-finned fishes make up half of all living vertebrate species. Nearly
all ray-finned fishes are teleosts, which include most commercially
important fish species, several model organisms for genomics and
developmental biology, and the dominant component of marine and freshwater
vertebrate faunas. Despite the economic and scientific importance
of ray-finned fishes, the lack of a single comprehensive phylogeny
with corresponding divergence-time estimates has limited our understanding
of the evolution and diversification of this radiation. Our analyses,
which use multiple nuclear gene sequences in conjunction with 36
fossil age constraints, result in a well-supported phylogeny of all
major ray-finned fish lineages and molecular age estimates that are
generally consistent with the fossil record. This phylogeny informs
three long-standing problems: specifically identifying elopomorphs
(eels and tarpons) as the sister lineage of all other teleosts, providing
a unique hypothesis on the radiation of early euteleosts, and offering
a promising strategy for resolution of the "bush at the top of the
tree" that includes percomorphs and other spiny-finned teleosts.
Contrasting our divergence time estimates with studies using a single
nuclear gene or whole mitochondrial genomes, we find that the former
underestimates ages of the oldest ray-finned fish divergences, but
the latter dramatically overestimates ages for derived teleost lineages.
Our time-calibrated phylogeny reveals that much of the diversification
leading to extant groups of teleosts occurred between the late Mesozoic
and early Cenozoic, identifying this period as the "Second Age of
Fishes."},

	abstract = {Lineage sorting has been suggested as a major force in generating incongruent phylogenetic signal when multiple gene partitions are examined. The degree of lineage sorting can be estimated using the coalescent process and simulation studies have also pointed to a major role for incomplete lineage sorting as a factor in phylogenetic inference. Some recent empirical studies point to an extreme role for this phenomenon with up to 50-60\% of all informative genes showing incongruence as a result of lineage sorting. Here, we examine seven large multi-partition genome level data sets over a large range of taxonomic representation. We took the approach of examining outgroup choice and its impact on tree topology, by swapping outgroups into analyses with successively larger genetics distances to the ingroup. Our results indicate a linear relationship of outgroup distance with incongruence in the data sets we examined suggesting a strong random rooting effect. In addition, we attempted to estimate the degree of lineage sorting in several large genome level data sets by examining triads of very closely related taxa. This exercise resulted in much lower estimates of incongruent genes that could be the result of lineage sorting, with an overall estimate of around 10\% of the total number of genes in a genome showing incongruence as a result of true lineage sorting. Finally we examined the behavior of likelihood and parsimony approaches on the random rooting phenomenon. Likelihood tends to stabilize incongruence as outgroups get further and further away from the ingroup. In one extreme case, likelihood overcompensates for sequence divergence but increases random rooting causing long branch repulsion. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	doi = {10.1098/rstb.2008.0178},
	abstract = {The rate at which a given site in a gene sequence alignment evolves over time may vary. This phenomenon--known as heterotachy--can bias or distort phylogenetic trees inferred from models of sequence evolution that assume rates of evolution are constant. Here, we describe a phylogenetic mixture model designed to accommodate heterotachy. The method sums the likelihood of the data at each site over more than one set of branch lengths on the same tree topology. A branch-length set that is best for one site may differ from the branch-length set that is best for some other site, thereby allowing different sites to have different rates of change throughout the tree. Because rate variation may not be present in all branches, we use a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to identify those branches in which reliable amounts of heterotachy occur. We implement the method in combination with our 'pattern-heterogeneity' mixture model, applying it to simulated data and five published datasets. We find that complex evolutionary signals of heterotachy are routinely present over and above variation in the rate or pattern of evolution across sites, that the reversible-jump method requires far fewer parameters than conventional mixture models to describe it, and serves to identify the regions of the tree in which heterotachy is most pronounced. The reversible-jump procedure also removes the need for a posteriori tests of 'significance' such as the Akaike or Bayesian information criterion tests, or Bayes factors. Heterotachy has important consequences for the correct reconstruction of phylogenies as well as for tests of hypotheses that rely on accurate branch-length information. These include molecular clocks, analyses of tempo and mode of evolution, comparative studies and ancestral state reconstruction. The model is available from the authors' website, and can be used for the analysis of both nucleotide and morphological data.},

	abstract = {The complex correlation structure of a collection of orthologous DNA sequences is uniquely captured by the "ancestral recombination graph" (ARG), a complete record of coalescence and recombination events in the history of the sample. However, existing methods for ARG inference are computationally intensive, highly approximate, or limited to small numbers of sequences, and, as a consequence, explicit ARG inference is rarely used in applied population genomics. Here, we introduce a new algorithm for ARG inference that is efficient enough to apply to dozens of complete mammalian genomes. The key idea of our approach is to sample an ARG of [Formula: see text] chromosomes conditional on an ARG of [Formula: see text] chromosomes, an operation we call "threading." Using techniques based on hidden Markov models, we can perform this threading operation exactly, up to the assumptions of the sequentially Markov coalescent and a discretization of time. An extension allows for threading of subtrees instead of individual sequences. Repeated application of these threading operations results in highly efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers for ARGs. We have implemented these methods in a computer program called ARGweaver. Experiments with simulated data indicate that ARGweaver converges rapidly to the posterior distribution over ARGs and is effective in recovering various features of the ARG for dozens of sequences generated under realistic parameters for human populations. In applications of ARGweaver to 54 human genome sequences from Complete Genomics, we find clear signatures of natural selection, including regions of unusually ancient ancestry associated with balancing selection and reductions in allele age in sites under directional selection. The patterns we observe near protein-coding genes are consistent with a primary influence from background selection rather than hitchhiking, although we cannot rule out a contribution from recurrent selective sweeps.},

	abstract = {Genetic elements in HIV-1 subtype B tat and env are associated with neurotoxicity yet less is known about other subtypes. HIV-1 subtype C tat and env sequences were analyzed to determine viral genetic elements associated with neurocognitive impairment in a large Indian cohort. Population-based sequences of HIV-1 tat (exon 1) and env (C2-V3 coding region) were generated from blood plasma of HIV-infected patients in Pune, India. Participants were classified as cognitively normal or impaired based on neuropsychological assessment. Tests for signature residues, positive and negative selection, entropy, and ambiguous bases were performed using tools available through Los Alamos National Laboratory (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov) and Datamonkey (http://www.datamonkey.org). HIV-1 subtype C tat and env sequences were analyzed for 155 and 160 participants, of which 34-36\% were impaired. Two signature residues were unique to impaired participants in exon 1 of tat at codons 29 (arginine) and 68 (proline). Positive selection was noted at codon 29 among normal participants and at codon 68 in both groups. The signature at codon 29 was also a signature for low CD4+ ({\textless}200{\textbackslash}thinspacecells/mm(3) ) counts but remained associated with impairment after exclusion of those with low CD4+ counts. No unique genetic signatures were noted in env. In conclusion, two signature residues were identified in exon 1 of HIV-1 subtype C tat that were associated with neurocognitive impairment in India and not completely accounted for by HIV disease progression. These signatures support a linkage between diversifying selection in HIV-1 subtype C tat and neurocognitive impairment. J. Med.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:The gene duplication (GD) problem seeks a species tree that implies the fewest gene duplication events across a given collection of gene trees. Solving this problem makes it possible to use large gene families with complex histories of duplication and loss to infer phylogenetic trees. However, the GD problem is NP-hard, and therefore, most analyses use heuristics that lack any performance guarantee.RESULTS:We describe the first integer linear programming (ILP) formulation to solve instances of the gene duplication problem exactly. With simulations, we demonstrate that the ILP solution can solve problem instances with up to 14 taxa. Furthermore, we apply the new ILP solution to solve the gene duplication problem for the seed plant phylogeny using a 12-taxon, 6, 084-gene data set. The unique, optimal solution, which places Gnetales sister to the conifers, represents a new, large-scale genomic perspective on one of the most puzzling questions in plant systematics.CONCLUSIONS:Although the GD problem is NP-hard, our novel ILP solution for it can solve instances with data sets consisting of as many as 14 taxa and 1, 000 genes in a few hours. These are the largest instances that have been solved to optimally to date. Thus, this work can provide large-scale genomic perspectives on phylogenetic questions that previously could only be addressed by heuristic estimates.},

	url = {http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23424130},
	abstract = {Species tree estimation from multiple markers is complicated by the fact that gene trees can differ from each other (and from the true species tree) due to several biological processes, one of which is gene duplication and loss. Local search heuristics for two NP-hard optimization problems - minimize gene duplications (MGD) and minimize gene duplications and losses (MGDL) - are popular techniques for estimating species trees in the presence of gene duplication and loss. In this paper, we present an alternative approach to solving MGD and MGDL from rooted gene trees. First, we characterize each tree in terms of its "subtree-bipartitions" (a concept we introduce). Then we show that the MGD species tree is defined by a maximum weight clique in a vertex-weighted graph that can be computed from the subtree-bipartitions of the input gene trees, and the MGDL species tree is defined by a minimum weight clique in a similarly constructed graph. We also show that these optimal cliques can be found in polynomial time in the number of vertices of the graph using a dynamic programming algorithm (similar to that of Hallett and Lagergren(1)), because of the special structure of the graphs. Finally, we show that a constrained version of these problems, where the subtree-bipartitions of the species tree are drawn from the subtree-bipartitions of the input gene trees, can be solved in time that is polynomial in the number of gene trees and taxa. We have implemented our dynamic programming algorithm in a publicly available software tool, available at http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/phylo/software/dynadup/.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Species are considered the fundamental unit in many ecological and evolutionary analyses, yet accurate, complete, accessible taxonomic frameworks with which to identify them are often unavailable to researchers. In such cases DNA sequence-based species delimitation has been proposed as a means of estimating species boundaries for further analysis. Several methods have been proposed to accomplish this. Here we present a Bayesian implementation of an evolutionary model-based method, the general mixed Yule-coalescent model (GMYC). Our implementation integrates over the parameters of the model and uncertainty in phylogenetic relationships using the output of widely available phylogenetic models and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation in order to produce marginal probabilities of species identities.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: We conducted simulations testing the effects of species evolutionary history, levels of intraspecific sampling and number of nucleotides sequenced. We also re-analyze the dataset used to introduce the original GMYC model. We found that the model results are improved with addition of DNA sequence and increased sampling, although these improvements have limits. The most important factor in the success of the model is the underlying phylogenetic history of the species under consideration. Recent and rapid divergences result in higher amounts of uncertainty in the model and eventually cause the model to fail to accurately assess uncertainty in species limits.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the GMYC model can be useful under a wide variety of circumstances, particularly in cases where divergences are deeper, or taxon sampling is incomplete, as in many studies of ecological communities, but that, in accordance with expectations from coalescent theory, rapid, recent radiations may yield inaccurate results. Our implementation differs from existing ones in two ways: it allows for the accounting for important sources of uncertainty in the model (phylogenetic and in parameters specific to the model) and in the specification of informative prior distributions that can increase the precision of the model. We have incorporated this model into a user-friendly R package available on the authors' websites.},

Not all species follow the paradigm of vertical inheritance of their genetic material. While a great deal of research has flourished into the inference of phylogenetic trees, statistical methods to infer phylogenetic networks are still limited and under development. The main disadvantage of existing methods is a lack of scalability. Here, we present a statistical method to infer phylogenetic networks from multi-locus genetic data in a pseudolikelihood framework. Our model accounts for incomplete lineage sorting through the coalescent model, and for horizontal inheritance of genes through reticulation nodes in the network. Computation of the pseudolikelihood is fast and simple, and it avoids the burdensome calculation of the full likelihood which can be intractable with many species. Moreover, estimation at the quartet-level has the added computational benefit that it is easily parallelizable. Simulation studies comparing our method to a full likelihood approach show that our pseudolikelihood approach is much faster without compromising accuracy. We applied our method to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among swordtails and platyfishes (Xiphophorus: Poeciliidae), which is characterized by widespread hybridizations.},

The current view is based on limited data sets, either a single gene with many species (e.g., ribosomal RNA) or many genes but with only a few species. Because a reliable phylogenetic inference simultaneously requires numerous genes and numerous species, we assembled a very large data set containing 129 orthologous proteins (∼30,000 aligned amino acid positions) for 36 eukaryotic species. Included in the alignments are data from the choanoflagellate Monosiga ovata, obtained through the sequencing of about 1,000 cDNAs. We provide conclusive support for choanoflagellates as the closest relative of animals and for fungi as the second closest. The monophyly of Plantae and chromalveolates was recovered but without strong statistical support. Within animals, in contrast to the monophyly of Coelomata observed in several recent large-scale analyses, we recovered a paraphyletic Coelamata, with nematodes and platyhelminths nested within. To include a diverse sample of organisms, data from EST projects were used for several species, resulting in a large amount of missing data in our alignment (about 25\%). By using different approaches, we verify that the inferred phylogeny is not sensitive to these missing data. Therefore, this large data set provides a reliable phylogenetic framework for studying eukaryotic and animal evolution and will be easily extendable when large amounts of sequence information become available from a broader taxonomic range.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the advent of systems biology, biological knowledge is often represented today by networks. These include regulatory and metabolic networks, protein-protein interaction networks, and many others. At the same time, high-throughput genomics and proteomics techniques generate very large data sets, which require sophisticated computational analysis. Usually, separate and different analysis methodologies are applied to each of the two data types. An integrated investigation of network and high-throughput information together can improve the quality of the analysis by accounting simultaneously for topological network properties alongside intrinsic features of the high-throughput data. RESULTS: We describe a novel algorithmic framework for this challenge. We first transform the high-throughput data into similarity values, (e.g., by computing pairwise similarity of gene expression patterns from microarray data). Then, given a network of genes or proteins and similarity values between some of them, we seek connected sub-networks (or modules) that manifest high similarity. We develop algorithms for this problem and evaluate their performance on the osmotic shock response network in S. cerevisiae and on the human cell cycle network. We demonstrate that focused, biologically meaningful and relevant functional modules are obtained. In comparison with extant algorithms, our approach has higher sensitivity and higher specificity. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that our method can accurately identify functional modules. Hence, it carries the promise to be highly useful in analysis of high throughput data.},

We assessed the applicability of DNA barcoding (here the 5' half of the cytochrome c oxidase I) to a diverse community of butterflies from the upper Amazon, using a group with a well-established morphological taxonomy to serve as a reference. Only 77\% of species could be accurately identified using the barcode data, a figure that dropped to 68\% in species represented in the analyses by more than one geographical race and at least one congener. The use of additional mitochondrial sequence data hardly improved species identification, while a fragment of a nuclear gene resolved issues in some of the problematic species.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The derivation of domestic cattle from the extinct wild aurochs (Bos primigenius) has been well-documented by archaeological and genetic studies. Genetic studies point towards the Neolithic Near East as the centre of origin for Bos taurus, with some lines of evidence suggesting possible, albeit rare, genetic contributions from locally domesticated wild aurochsen across Eurasia. Inferences from these investigations have been based largely on the analysis of partial mitochondrial DNA sequences generated from modern animals, with limited sequence data from ancient aurochsen samples. Recent developments in DNA sequencing technologies, however, are affording new opportunities for the examination of genetic material retrieved from extinct species, providing new insight into their evolutionary history. Here we present DNA sequence analysis of the first complete mitochondrial genome (16,338 base pairs) from an archaeologically-verified and exceptionally-well preserved aurochs bone sample.

METHODOLOGY: DNA extracts were generated from an aurochs humerus bone sample recovered from a cave site located in Derbyshire, England and radiocarbon-dated to 6,738+/-68 calibrated years before present. These extracts were prepared for both Sanger and next generation DNA sequencing technologies (Illumina Genome Analyzer). In total, 289.9 megabases (22.48\%) of the post-filtered DNA sequences generated using the Illumina Genome Analyzer from this sample mapped with confidence to the bovine genome. A consensus B. primigenius mitochondrial genome sequence was constructed and was analysed alongside all available complete bovine mitochondrial genome sequences.

CONCLUSIONS: For all nucleotide positions where both Sanger and Illumina Genome Analyzer sequencing methods gave high-confidence calls, no discrepancies were observed. Sequence analysis reveals evidence of heteroplasmy in this sample and places this mitochondrial genome sequence securely within a previously identified aurochsen haplogroup (haplogroup P), thus providing novel insights into pre-domestic patterns of variation. The high proportion of authentic, endogenous aurochs DNA preserved in this sample bodes well for future efforts to determine the complete genome sequence of a wild ancestor of domestic cattle.},

	abstract = {The appropriate interpretation of bootstrap support for splits and the question of what constitutes large bootstrap support have received considerable attention. One desirable interpretation, indeed the interpretation that was put forward when bootstrap support for splits was first introduced, is that 1-minus bootstrap support is a P value for the hypothesis that the split is not well resolved. As a P value, bootstrap support has been argued to be first-order correct. By obtaining the limiting distribution of bootstrap support for a split when maximum likelihood estimation is conducted, it is shown that bootstrap support is not first-order correct and insight is provided into the nature of the problem. Borrowing from earlier results, it is also shown that similar results hold when the neighbor-joining algorithm is used. Examples suggest that bootstrap support is generally conservative as a P value and give insight as to why this is usually the case. The analysis indicates that the problem is largely due to the unusual nature of tree space where boundary trees always have at least 2 neighbors.},

	abstract = {RAxML-VI-HPC (randomized axelerated maximum likelihood for high performance computing) is a sequential and parallel program for inference of large phylogenies with maximum likelihood (ML). Low-level technical optimizations, a modification of the search algorithm, and the use of the GTR+CAT approximation as replacement for GTR+Gamma yield a program that is between 2.7 and 52 times faster than the previous version of RAxML. A large-scale performance comparison with GARLI, PHYML, IQPNNI and MrBayes on real data containing 1000 up to 6722 taxa shows that RAxML requires at least 5.6 times less main memory and yields better trees in similar times than the best competing program (GARLI) on datasets up to 2500 taxa. On datasets {\textgreater} or =4000 taxa it also runs 2-3 times faster than GARLI. RAxML has been parallelized with MPI to conduct parallel multiple bootstraps and inferences on distinct starting trees. The program has been used to compute ML trees on two of the largest alignments to date containing 25,057 (1463 bp) and 2182 (51,089 bp) taxa, respectively.

Background: Given a new biological sequence, detecting membership in a known family is a basic step in many bioinformatics analyses, with applications to protein structure and function prediction and metagenomic taxon identification and abundance profiling, among others. Yet family identification of sequences that are distantly related to sequences in public databases or that are fragmentary remains one of the more difficult analytical problems in bioinformatics. Results: We present a new technique for family identification called HIPPI (Hierarchical Profile Hidden Markov Models for Protein family Identification). HIPPI uses a novel technique to represent a multiple sequence alignment for a given protein family or superfamily by an ensemble of profile hidden Markov models computed using HMMER. An evaluation of HIPPI on the Pfam database shows that HIPPI has better overall precision and recall than blastp, HMMER, and pipelines based on HHsearch, and maintains good accuracy even for fragmentary query sequences  and for protein families with low average pairwise sequence identity, both conditions where other methods degrade in accuracy. Conclusion: HIPPI provides accurate protein family identification and is robust to difficult model conditions. Our results, combined with observations from previous studies, show that ensembles of profile Hidden Markov models can better represent multiple sequence alignments than a single profile Hidden Markov model, and thus can improve downstream analyses for various bioinformatic tasks. Further research is needed to determine the best practices for building the ensemble of profile Hidden Markov models. HIPPI is available on GitHub at https://github.com/smirarab/sepp.},

Our new and robust phylogenetic framework has substantial implications for the interpretation of various conclusions drawn from passerines as model organisms.

	volume = {10},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tunicates represent a key metazoan group as the sister-group of vertebrates within chordates. The six complete mitochondrial genomes available so far for tunicates have revealed distinctive features. Extensive gene rearrangements and particularly high evolutionary rates have been evidenced with regard to other chordates. This peculiar evolutionary dynamics has hampered the reconstruction of tunicate phylogenetic relationships within chordates based on mitogenomic data. RESULTS: In order to further understand the atypical evolutionary dynamics of the mitochondrial genome of tunicates, we determined the complete sequence of the solitary ascidian Herdmania momus. This genome from a stolidobranch ascidian presents the typical tunicate gene content with 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNAs and 24 tRNAs which are all encoded on the same strand. However, it also presents a novel gene arrangement, highlighting the extreme plasticity of gene order observed in tunicate mitochondrial genomes. Probabilistic phylogenetic inferences were conducted on the concatenation of the 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes from representatives of major metazoan phyla. We show that whereas standard homogeneous amino acid models support an artefactual sister position of tunicates relative to all other bilaterians, the CAT and CAT+BP site- and time-heterogeneous mixture models place tunicates as the sister-group of vertebrates within monophyletic chordates. Moreover, the reference phylogeny indicates that tunicate mitochondrial genomes have experienced a drastic acceleration in their evolutionary rate that equally affects protein-coding and ribosomal-RNA genes. CONCLUSION: This is the first mitogenomic study supporting the new chordate phylogeny revealed by recent phylogenomic analyses. It illustrates the beneficial effects of an increased taxon sampling coupled with the use of more realistic amino acid substitution models for the reconstruction of animal phylogeny.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic networks are models of evolution that go beyond trees, incorporating non-tree-like biological events such as recombination (or more generally reticulation), which occur either in a single species (meiotic recombination) or between species (reticulation due to lateral gene transfer and hybrid speciation). The central algorithmic problems are to reconstruct a plausible history of mutations and non-tree-like events, or to determine the minimum number of such events needed to derive a given set of binary sequences, allowing one mutation per site. Meiotic recombination, reticulation and recurrent mutation can cause conflict or incompatibility between pairs of sites (or characters) of the input. Previously, we used "conflict graphs" and "incompatibility graphs" to compute lower bounds on the minimum number of recombination nodes needed, and to efficiently solve constrained cases of the minimization problem. Those results exposed the structural and algorithmic importance of the non-trivial connected components of those two graphs. In this paper, we more fully develop the structural importance of non-trivial connected components of the incompatibility and conflict graphs, proving a general decomposition theorem (Gusfield and Bansal, 2005) for phylogenetic networks. The decomposition theorem depends only on the incompatibilities in the input sequences, and hence applies to many types of phylogenetic networks, and to any biological phenomena that causes pairwise incompatibilities. More generally, the proof of the decomposition theorem exposes a maximal embedded tree structure that exists in the network when the sequences cannot be derived on a perfect phylogenetic tree. This extends the theory of perfect phylogeny in a natural and important way. The proof is constructive and leads to a polynomial-time algorithm to find the unique underlying maximal tree structure. We next examine and fully solve the major open question from Gusfield and Bansal (2005): Is it true that for every input there must be a fully decomposed phylogenetic network that minimizes the number of recombination nodes used, over all phylogenetic networks for the input. We previously conjectured that the answer is yes. In this paper, we show that the answer in is no, both for the case that only single-crossover recombination is allowed, and also for the case that unbounded multiple-crossover recombination is allowed. The latter case also resolves a conjecture recently stated in (Huson and Klopper, 2007) in the context of reticulation networks. Although the conjecture from Gusfield and Bansal (2005) is disproved in general, we show that the answer to the conjecture is yes in several natural special cases, and establish necessary combinatorial structure that counterexamples to the conjecture must possess. We also show that counterexamples to the conjecture are rare (for the case of single-crossover recombination) in simulated data.},

Here we consider the expected amount of incongruence arising from ILS, as modeled by the coalescent process. In particular, we compute the probability that two gene trees randomly sampled from the same species tree agree with one another as well as the distribution of the Robinson-Foulds distance between them, for species trees with three to eight taxa. We demonstrate that, as expected under the coalescent model, the amount of discordance is affected by species tree-specific factors such as speciation times and effective population sizes for the species under consideration. Our results highlight the fact that substantial discordance may occur, even when the number of species is very small, which has implications both for larger taxon samples and for any method that uses estimated gene trees as the basis for further statistical inference. The amount of incongruence is substantial enough that such methods may need to be modified to account for variability in the underlying gene trees.},

Anurans (frogs and toads) exhibit a remarkable diversity of reproductive modes that is unique among terrestrial vertebrates. Here, we analyze the evolution of these modes, using comparative methods on a phylogeny and matched life-history database of 720 species, including most families and modes. As expected, modes with terrestrial eggs and aquatic larvae often precede direct development (terrestrial egg, no tadpole stage), but surprisingly, direct development evolves directly from aquatic breeding nearly as often. Modes with primitive exotrophic larvae (feeding outside the egg) frequently give rise to direct developers, whereas those with nonfeeding larvae (endotrophic) do not. Similarly, modes with eggs and larvae placed in locations protected from aquatic predators evolve frequently but rarely give rise to direct developers. Thus, frogs frequently bypass many seemingly intermediate stages in the evolution of direct development. We also find significant associations between terrestrial reproduction and reduced clutch size, larger egg size, reduced adult size, parental care, and occurrence in wetter and warmer regions. These associations may help explain the widespread retention of aquatic eggs and larvae, and the overall diversity of anuran reproductive modes.},

However, the data used for the latter studies came from various sources and technologies, involved poorly-occupied matrices and lacked key lineages. Here we generated a new Illumina-based dataset to address annelid relationships from a fresh perspective, independent from previously generated data and with nearly fully-occupied matrices. Our sampling reflects the span of annelid diversity, including two symbiotic annelid groups (Myzostomida and Spinther) and five meiofaunal groups once referred to as part of Archiannelida (three from Protodrilida, plus Dinophilus and Polygordius). As well as the placement of these unusual annelids, we sought to address the overall phylogeny of Annelida, and provide a new perspective for naming of major clades. Our results largely corroborate the phylogenomic results of Weigert et al. (2014), with “Magelona + Owenia” and Chaetopteridae forming a grade with respect to all other annelids. Echiura and Sipuncula are supported as being annelid groups, with Sipuncula closest to amphinomids as sister group to Sedentaria and Errantia. We recovered the three Protodrilida terminals as sister clade to Phyllodocida and Eunicida (= clade Aciculata). We therefore place Protodrilida as part of Errantia. Polygordius was found to be sister group to the scaleworm terminal and the possibility that it is a simplified scaleworm clade, as has been shown for the former family Pisionidae, is discussed. Our results were equivocal with respect to Dinophilus, Myzostomida and Spinther possibly owing to confounding long-branch effects.},

Studies on these groups are valuable in that they would speak to the long-term phylogenetic success of lineages following gene flow between species. We present a phylogenomic view of Heuchera, long known for frequent hybridization, incorporating all three independent genomes: targeted nuclear ({\textasciitilde}400,000 bp), plastid ({\textasciitilde}160,000 bp) and mitochondrial ({\textasciitilde}470,000 bp) data. We analyze these data using multiple concatenation and coalescence strategies.The nuclear phylogeny is consistent with previous work and with morphology, confidently suggesting a monophyletic Heuchera. By contrast, analyses of both organellar genomes recover a grossly polyphyletic Heuchera, consisting of three primary clades with relationships extensively rearranged within these as well. A minority of nuclear loci also exhibit phylogenetic discord; yet these topologies remarkably never resemble the pattern of organellar loci and largely present low levels of discord inter alia. Two independent estimates of the coalescent branch length of the ancestor of Heuchera using nuclear data suggest rare or non-existent incomplete lineage sorting with related clades, inconsistent with the observed gross polyphyly of organellar genomes (confirmed by simulation of gene trees under the coalescent). These observations, in combination with previous work, strongly suggest hybridization as the cause of this phylogenetic discord.},

	abstract = {Aporometra Clark, 1938, which belongs to the monotypic Aporometridae, is a crinoid genus endemic to temperate Australian waters. It has been described as being ‘viviparous’ and is among the smallest of comatulids. The small size of specimens, and poor morphological justifications for specific diagnoses have created uncertainty over the number of species in the genus and their distributions. This study identified a suite of characters using data from scanning electron microscopy and mtDNA sequencing (CO1 and ND2) to assess the number of species of Aporometra. Specimens were obtained from museums and collected from Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. Type material was also examined when possible. Phylogenetic hypotheses were generated using maximum parsimony-based analyses of the separate and combined datasets. The results support the monophyly of Aporometra and the presence of two species, Aporometra wilsoni (Bell, 1888) and Aporometra occidentalis A. H. Clark, 1938, along the southern Australian coast. The status of the third nominal species, Aporometra paedophora (H. L. Clark, 1909), remains to be resolved, but it may be a junior synonym of A. wilsoni. Morphological diagnoses are reviewed. Aporometra occidentalis was only found in Western Australia, while A. wilsoni was found from Western Australia to Victoria. Phylogeographic differentiation between the western and southern populations of A. wilsoni is briefly discussed.},

The extent of these events casts doubt on the feasibility of constructing a 'Tree of Life', because the trees for different genes often tell different stories. However, alternative approaches to tree construction that attempt to determine tree topology on the basis of comparisons of complete gene sets seem to reveal a phylogenetic signal that supports the three-domain evolutionary scenario and suggests the possibility of delineation of previously undetected major clades of prokaryotes. If the validity of these whole-genome approaches to tree building is confirmed by analyses of numerous new genomes, which are currently being sequenced at an increasing rate, it would seem that the concept of a universal 'species' tree is still appropriate. However, this tree should be reinterpreted as a prevailing trend in the evolution of genome-scale gene sets rather than as a complete picture of evolution.},

We find that when the trees being compared are similar, measures that make use of branch lengths are superior, with the branch-length version of the Robinson–Foulds metric performing best. In contrast, for dissimilar trees topology-only measures are superior, with the Alignment metric of Nye et al. performing best. We also apply the measures to a mammalian dataset and observe that the best metric depends on whether branch-length information is of interest.

We present new experimental results (that extend those we presented at ISMB'01 and WABI'01) that demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our distance estimators under a wide range of model conditions. Moreover, using the best of our distance estimators (EDE) in our GRAPPA software suite, along with more sophisticated bounding techniques, produced spectacular improvements in the already huge speedup: whereas our earlier experiments showed a one-million-fold speedup (when run on a 512-processor cluster), our latest experiments demonstrate a speedup of one hundred million. The combination of these various advances enabled us to conduct new phylogenetic analyses of a subset of the Campanulaceae family, confirming various conjectures about the relationships among members of the subset and confirming that inversion can be viewed as the principal mechanism of evolution for their chloroplast genome.

Within one of the networks (composed of 38 subjects) we found only a subset of the tested sequence clusters was consistent with the reported epidemiological linkage. Of 15 presumed transmission events where sequence data were available, 9 could be rejected either by subtype mismatch or by phylogenetic tests. In the other network (composed of 89 subjects) we were able to assess sequences for 26 presumed transmission events, 18 of which were rejected based on subtype discordance. Long lags in time between the time of transmission and the time of sequence sampling (ranging from 2 to 18 years) may limit the sensitivity for the detection of sequence linkage.

The large effort to compile global plant functional trait databases largely for the purpose of mapping and analyzing the spatial distribution of function has resulted in very sparse data matrices thereby limiting progress. Identifying robust methodologies to gap fill or impute trait values in these databases is an important objective. Here I argue that existing statistical tools from phylogenetic comparative methods can be used to rapidly impute values into global plant functional trait databases due to the large amount of phylogenetic signal often in trait data. In particular, statistical models of phylogenetic signal in traits can be generated from existing data and used to predict missing values of closely related species often with a high degree of accuracy thereby facilitating the continental-scale mapping of plant function. Despite the promise of this approach, I also discuss potential pitfalls and future challenges that will need to be addressed.},

We observe many improvements in reconstruction accuracy, achieved by modeling multiple aspects of evolution, including gene duplication and loss (DL) rates, speciation times, and correlated substitution rate variation across both species and loci. We have implemented and applied this method on two clades of fully sequenced species, 12 Drosophila and 16 fungal genomes as well as simulated phylogenies and find dramatic improvements in reconstruction accuracy as compared with the most popular existing methods, including those that take the species tree into account. We find that reconstruction inaccuracies of traditional phylogenetic methods overestimate the number of DL events by as much as 2-3-fold, whereas our method achieves significantly higher accuracy.

	abstract = {The intestinal microbiota consists of over 1000 species, which play key roles in gut physiology and homeostasis. Imbalances in the composition of this bacterial community can lead to transient intestinal dysfunctions and chronic disease states. Understanding how to manipulate this ecosystem is thus essential for treating many disorders. In this study, we took advantage of recently developed tools for deep sequencing and phylogenetic clustering to examine the long-term effects of exogenous microbiota transplantation combined with and without an antibiotic pretreatment. In our rat model, deep sequencing revealed an intestinal bacterial diversity exceeding that of the human gut by a factor of two to three. The transplantation produced a marked increase in the microbial diversity of the recipients, which stemmed from both capture of new phylotypes and increase in abundance of others. However, when transplantation was performed after antibiotic intake, the resulting state simply combined the reshaping effects of the individual treatments (including the reduced diversity from antibiotic treatment alone). Therefore, lowering the recipient bacterial load by antibiotic intake prior to transplantation did not increase establishment of the donor phylotypes, although some dominant lineages still transferred successfully. Remarkably, all of these effects were observed after 1 mo of treatment and persisted after 3 mo. Overall, our results indicate that the indigenous gut microbial composition is more plastic that previously anticipated. However, since antibiotic pretreatment counterintuitively interferes with the establishment of an exogenous community, such plasticity is likely conditioned more by the altered microbiome gut homeostasis caused by antibiotics than by the primary bacterial loss.},

	abstract = {The desire to infer the evolutionary history of a group of species should be more viable now that a considerable amount of multilocus molecular data is available. However, the current molecular phylogenetic paradigm still reconstructs gene trees to represent the species tree. Further, commonly used methods of combining data, such as the concatenation method, are known to be inconsistent in some circumstances. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the phylogeny of a group of species using multiple estimated gene tree distributions, such as those that arise in a Bayesian analysis of DNA sequence data. Our model employs substitution models used in traditional phylogenetics but also uses coalescent theory to explain genealogical signals from species trees to gene trees and from gene trees to sequence data, thereby forming a complete stochastic model to estimate gene trees, species trees, ancestral population sizes, and species divergence times simultaneously. Our model is founded on the assumption that gene trees, even of unlinked loci, are correlated due to being derived from a single species tree and therefore should be estimated jointly. We apply the method to two multilocus data sets of DNA sequences. The estimates of the species tree topology and divergence times appear to be robust to the prior of the population size, whereas the estimates of effective population sizes are sensitive to the prior used in the analysis. These analyses also suggest that the model is superior to the concatenation method in fitting these data sets and thus provides a more realistic assessment of the variability in the distribution of the species tree that may have produced the molecular information at hand. Future improvements of our model and algorithm should include consideration of other factors that can cause discordance of gene trees and species trees, such as horizontal transfer or gene duplication.},

RESULTS: We study a universal double-cut-and-join operation that accounts for inversions, translocations, fissions and fusions, but also produces circular intermediates which can be reabsorbed. The genomic distance, computable in linear time, is given by the number of breakpoints minus the number of cycles (b-c) in the comparison graph of the two genomes; the number of hurdles does not enter into it. Without changing the formula, we can replace generation and re-absorption of a circular intermediate by a generalized transposition, equivalent to a block interchange, with weight two.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Uncovering how populations of a species differ genetically and ecologically is important for understanding evolutionary processes. Here we combine population genetic methods (microsatellites) with phylogenetic information (mtDNA) to define genetic population clusters of the wide-spread Neotropical túngara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus). We measure gene flow and migration within and between population clusters and compare genetic diversity between population clusters. By applying ecological niche modeling we determine whether the two most divergent genetic groups of the túngara frog (1) inhabit different habitats, and (2) are separated geographically by unsuitable habitat across a gap in the distribution.

RESULTS: Most population structure is captured by dividing all sample localities into two allopatric genetic lineages. The Northern genetic lineage (NW Costa Rica) is genetically homogenous while the Southern lineage (SW Costa Rica and Panama) is sub-divided into three population clusters by both microsatellite and mtDNA analyses. Gene flow is higher within the Northern lineage than within the Southern lineage, perhaps due to increased landscape heterogeneity in the South. Niche modeling reveals differences in suitable habitat between the Northern and Southern lineages: the Northern lineage inhabits dry/pine-oak forests, while the Southern lineage is confined to tropical moist forests. Both lineages seem to have had little movement across the distribution gap, which persisted during the last glacial maximum. The lack of movement was more pronounced for the Southern lineage than for the Northern lineage.

CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the finding of previous studies that túngara frogs diverged into two allopatric genetic lineages north and south of the gap in the distribution in central Costa Rica several million years ago. The allopatric distribution is attributed to unsuitable habitat and probably other unknown ecological factors present across the distribution gap. Niche conservatism possibly contributes to preventing movements across the gap and gene flow between both groups. Genetic and ecological data indicate that there is the potential for ecological divergence in allopatry between lineages. In this context we discuss whether the Northern and Southern lineages should be recognized as separate species, and we conclude that further studies of pre- and post-zygotic isolation are needed for a final assessment. Identified population clusters should motivate future behavioral and ecological research regarding within-species biodiversity and speciation mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Inferring the relationships among Bilateria has been an active and controversial research area since Haeckel. The lack of a sufficient number of phylogenetically reliable characters was the main limitation of traditional phylogenies based on morphology. With the advent of molecular data, this problem has been replaced by another one, statistical inconsistency, which stems from an erroneous interpretation of convergences induced by multiple changes. The analysis of alignments rich in both genes and species, combined with a probabilistic method (maximum likelihood or Bayesian) using sophisticated models of sequence evolution, should alleviate these two major limitations. We applied this approach to a dataset of 94 genes and 79 species using CAT, a previously developed model accounting for site-specific amino acid replacement patterns. The resulting tree is in good agreement with current knowledge: the monophyly of most major groups (e.g. Chordata, Arthropoda, Lophotrochozoa, Ecdysozoa, Protostomia) was recovered with high support. Two results are surprising and are discussed in an evo-devo framework: the sister-group relationship of Platyhelminthes and Annelida to the exclusion of Mollusca, contradicting the Neotrochozoa hypothesis, and, with a lower statistical support, the paraphyly of Deuterostomia. These results, in particular the status of deuterostomes, need further confirmation, both through increased taxonomic sampling, and future improvements of probabilistic models.},

	abstract = {Prokaryotic organisms share genetic material across species boundaries by means of a process known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Detecting this process bears great significance on understanding prokaryotic genome diversification and unraveling their complexities. Phylogeny-based detection of HGT is one of the most commonly used approaches for this task, and is based on the fundamental fact that HGT may cause gene trees to disagree with one another, as well as with the species phylogeny. Hence, methods that adopt this approach compare gene and species trees, and infer a set of HGT events to reconcile the differences among these trees. In this paper, we address some of the identifiability issues that face phylogeny-based detection of HGT. In particular, we show the effect of inaccuracies in the reconstructed (species and gene) trees on inferring the correct number of HGT events. Further, we show that a large number of maximally parsimonious HGT scenarios may exist. These results indicate that accurate detection of HGT requires accurate reconstruction of individual trees, and necessitates the search for more than a single scenario to explain gene tree disagreements. Finally, we show that disagreements among trees may be a result of not only HGT, but also lineage sorting, and make initial progress on incorporating HGT into the coalescent model, so as to stochastically distinguish between the two and make an accurate reconciliation. This contribution is very significant, particularly when analyzing closely related organisms.},

	abstract = {The phylogenetic relationship of the now fully sequenced species Drosophila erecta and D. yakuba with respect to the D. melanogaster species complex has been a subject of controversy. All three possible groupings of the species have been reported in the past, though recent multi-gene studies suggest that D. erecta and D. yakuba are sister species. Using the whole genomes of each of these species as well as the four other fully sequenced species in the subgenus Sophophora, we set out to investigate the placement of D. erecta and D. yakuba in the D. melanogaster species group and to understand the cause of the past incongruence. Though we find that the phylogeny grouping D. erecta and D. yakuba together is the best supported, we also find widespread incongruence in nucleotide and amino acid substitutions, insertions and deletions, and gene trees. The time inferred to span the two key speciation events is short enough that under the coalescent model, the incongruence could be the result of incomplete lineage sorting. Consistent with the lineage-sorting hypothesis, substitutions supporting the same tree were spatially clustered. Support for the different trees was found to be linked to recombination such that adjacent genes support the same tree most often in regions of low recombination and substitutions supporting the same tree are most enriched roughly on the same scale as linkage disequilibrium, also consistent with lineage sorting. The incongruence was found to be statistically significant and robust to model and species choice. No systematic biases were found. We conclude that phylogenetic incongruence in the D. melanogaster species complex is the result, at least in part, of incomplete lineage sorting. Incomplete lineage sorting will likely cause phylogenetic incongruence in many comparative genomics datasets. Methods to infer the correct species tree, the history of every base in the genome, and comparative methods that control for and/or utilize this information will be valuable advancements for the field of comparative genomics.},

We show, through extensive coalescent-based simulations of multilocus data sets on phylogenetic networks, how divergence times before and after hybridization events can result in incomplete lineage sorting with gene tree incongruence signatures identical to those exhibited by hybridization. Evolutionary analysis of such data under the assumption of a species tree model can miss all hybridization events, whereas analysis under the assumption of a species network model would grossly overestimate hybridization events. These issues necessitate a paradigm shift in evolutionary analysis under these scenarios, from a model that assumes a priori a single source of gene tree incongruence to one that integrates multiple sources in a unifying framework. We propose a framework of coalescence within the branches of a phylogenetic network and show how this framework can be used to detect hybridization despite incomplete lineage sorting. We apply the model to simulated data and show that the signature of hybridization can be revealed as long as the interval between the divergence times of the species involved in hybridization is not too small. We reanalyze a data set of 106 loci from 7 in-group Saccharomyces species for which a species tree with no hybridization has been reported in the literature. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that hybridization occurred during the evolution of this group, explaining a large amount of the incongruence in the data. Our findings show that an integrative approach to gene tree incongruence and its reconciliation is needed. Our framework will help in systematically analyzing genomic data for the occurrence of hybridization and elucidating its evolutionary role.},

These collections could provide the information necessary to reconstruct their own history - the sequence of changes introduced into the lineage during the development of the clone - and to study affinity maturation in detail. But the success of such a program depends entirely on accurately inferring the founding ancestor and the other unobserved intermediates. Given a set of clonally related immunoglobulin V-region genes, the method described here allows one to compute the posterior distribution over their possible ancestors, thereby giving a thorough accounting of the uncertainty inherent in the reconstruction.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevention remains a public health priority. Simple, practical interventions to reduce STD incidence that can be easily and inexpensively administered in high-volume clinical settings are needed. We evaluated whether a brief video, which contained STD prevention messages targeted to all patients in the waiting room, reduced acquisition of new infections after that clinic visit. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In a controlled trial among patients attending three publicly funded STD clinics (one in each of three US cities) from December 2003 to August 2005, all patients (n = 38,635) were systematically assigned to either a theory-based 23-min video depicting couples overcoming barriers to safer sexual behaviors, or the standard waiting room environment. Condition assignment alternated every 4 wk and was determined by which condition (intervention or control) was in place in the clinic waiting room during the patient's first visit within the study period. An intent-to-treat analysis was used to compare STD incidence between intervention and control patients. The primary endpoint was time to diagnosis of incident laboratory-confirmed infections (gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, syphilis, and HIV), as identified through review of medical records and county STD surveillance registries. During 14.8 mo (average) of follow-up, 2,042 patients (5.3\%) were diagnosed with incident STD (4.9\%, intervention condition; 5.7\%, control condition). In survival analysis, patients assigned to the intervention condition had significantly fewer STDs compared with the control condition (hazard ratio [HR], 0.91; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Showing a brief video in STD clinic waiting rooms reduced new infections nearly 10\% overall in three clinics. This simple, low-intensity intervention may be appropriate for adoption by clinics that serve similar patient populations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov (\#NCT00137670).},

	volume = {9},
	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18662388},
	abstract = {Background: Phylogenies, i.e., the evolutionary histories of groups of taxa, play a major role in representing the interrelationships among biological entities. Many software tools for reconstructing and evaluating such phylogenies have been proposed, almost all of which assume the underlying evolutionary history to be a tree. While trees give a satisfactory first-order approximation for many families of organisms, other families exhibit evolutionary mechanisms that cannot be represented by trees. Processes such as horizontal gene transfer (HGT), hybrid speciation, and interspecific recombination, collectively referred to as reticulate evolutionary events, result in networks, rather than trees, of relationships. Various software tools have been recently developed to analyze reticulate evolutionary relationships, which include SplitsTree4, LatTrans, EEEP, HorizStory, and T-REX. Results: In this paper, we report on the PhyloNet software package, which is a suite of tools for analyzing reticulate evolutionary relationships, or evolutionary networks, which are rooted, directed, acyclic graphs, leaf-labeled by a set of taxa. These tools can be classified into four categories: (1) evolutionary network representation: reading/writing evolutionary networks in a newly devised compact form; (2) evolutionary network characterization: analyzing evolutionary networks in terms of three basic building blocks trees, clusters, and tripartitions; (3) evolutionary network comparison: comparing two evolutionary networks in terms of topological dissimilarities, as well as fitness to sequence evolution under a maximum parsimony criterion; and (4) evolutionary network reconstruction: reconstructing an evolutionary network from a species tree and a set of gene trees. Conclusion: The software package, PhyloNet, offers an array of utilities to allow for efficient and accurate analysis of evolutionary networks. The software package will help significantly in analyzing large data sets, as well as in studying the performance of evolutionary network reconstruction methods. Further, the software package supports the proposed eNewick format for compact representation of evolutionary networks, a feature that allows for efficient interoperability of evolutionary network software tools. Currently, all utilities in PhyloNet are invoked on the command line.},

	abstract = {The evolutionary relationships of gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates), which comprise chondrichthyans (cartilaginous fishes), lobe-finned fishes (coelacanths and lungfishes), tetrapods, and actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes), have been debated for almost a century. Phylogenetic analyses based on fossils, morphology, and molecular sequences have generated different models of relationships that remain unresolved. We identified 13 derived shared molecular markers (synapomorphies) that define clades in the vertebrate lineage and used them to resolve the phylogenetic relationships of extant jawed vertebrates. Our markers include the presence or absence of insertions and deletions in coding sequences, nuclear introns, and alternatively spliced transcripts. The synapomorphies identified by us are congruent with each other and give rise to a single phylogenetic tree. This tree confirms that chondrichthyans are basal to all living gnathostomes, that lungfishes (Dipnoi) are the closest living relatives of tetrapods, and that bichirs (Cladistia) are the living members of the most ancient family of ray-finned fishes. Our study also provides molecular evidence to support the monophyly of living tetrapods and teleosts.},

	abstract = {The human antibody repertoire is one of the most important defenses against infectious disease, and the development of vaccines has enabled the conferral of targeted protection to specific pathogens. However, there are many challenges to measuring and analyzing the immunoglobulin sequence repertoire, including that each B cell's genome encodes a distinct antibody sequence, that the antibody repertoire changes over time, and the high similarity between antibody sequences. We have addressed these challenges by using high-throughput long read sequencing to perform immunogenomic characterization of expressed human antibody repertoires in the context of influenza vaccination. Informatic analysis of 5 million antibody heavy chain sequences from healthy individuals allowed us to perform global characterizations of isotype distributions, determine the lineage structure of the repertoire, and measure age- and antigen-related mutational activity. Our analysis of the clonal structure and mutational distribution of individuals' repertoires shows that elderly subjects have a decreased number of lineages but an increased prevaccination mutation load in their repertoire and that some of these subjects have an oligoclonal character to their repertoire in which the diversity of the lineages is greatly reduced relative to younger subjects. We have thus shown that global analysis of the immune system's clonal structure provides direct insight into the effects of vaccination and provides a detailed molecular portrait of age-related effects.},

	volume = {104},
	abstract = {The vast majority of phylogenetic models focus on resolution of gene trees, despite the fact that phylogenies of species in which gene trees are embedded are of primary interest. We analyze a Bayesian model for estimating species trees that accounts for the stochastic variation expected for gene trees from multiple unlinked loci sampled from a single species history after a coalescent process. Application of the model to a 106-gene data set from yeast shows that the set of gene trees recovered by statistically acknowledging the shared but unknown species tree from which gene trees are sampled is much reduced compared with treating the history of each locus independently of an overarching species tree. The analysis also yields a concentrated posterior distribution of the yeast species tree whose mode is congruent with the concatenated gene tree but can do so with less than half the loci required by the concatenation method. Using simulations, we show that, with large numbers of loci, highly resolved species trees can be estimated under conditions in which concatenation of sequence data will positively mislead phylogeny, and when the proportion of gene trees matching the species tree is {\textless}10\%. However, when gene tree/species tree congruence is high, species trees can be resolved with just two or three loci. These results make accessible an alternative paradigm for combining data in phylogenomics that focuses attention on the singularity of species histories and away from the idiosyncrasies and multiplicities of individual gene histories.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-14-158},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Scientists rarely reuse expert knowledge of phylogeny, in spite of years of effort to assemble a great "Tree of Life" (ToL). A notable exception involves the use of Phylomatic, which provides tools to generate custom phylogenies from a large, pre-computed, expert phylogeny of plant taxa. This suggests great potential for a more generalized system that, starting with a query consisting of a list of any known species, would rectify non-standard names, identify expert phylogenies containing the implicated taxa, prune away unneeded parts, and supply branch lengths and annotations, resulting in a custom phylogeny suited to the user's needs. Such a system could become a sustainable community resource if implemented as a distributed system of loosely coupled parts that interact through clearly defined interfaces. RESULTS: With the aim of building such a "phylotastic" system, the NESCent Hackathons, Interoperability, Phylogenies (HIP) working group recruited 2 dozen scientist-programmers to a weeklong programming hackathon in June 2012. During the hackathon (and a three-month follow-up period), 5 teams produced designs, implementations, documentation, presentations, and tests including: (1) a generalized scheme for integrating components; (2) proof-of-concept pruners and controllers; (3) a meta-API for taxonomic name resolution services; (4) a system for storing, finding, and retrieving phylogenies using semantic web technologies for data exchange, storage, and querying; (5) an innovative new service, DateLife.org, which synthesizes pre-computed, time-calibrated phylogenies to assign ages to nodes; and (6) demonstration projects. These outcomes are accessible via a public code repository (GitHub.com), a website (http://www.phylotastic.org), and a server image. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 9 person-months of effort (centered on a software development hackathon) resulted in the design and implementation of proof-of-concept software for 4 core phylotastic components, 3 controllers, and 3 end-user demonstration tools. While these products have substantial limitations, they suggest considerable potential for a distributed system that makes phylogenetic knowledge readily accessible in computable form. Widespread use of phylotastic systems will create an electronic marketplace for sharing phylogenetic knowledge that will spur innovation in other areas of the ToL enterprise, such as annotation of sources and methods and third-party methods of quality assessment.},

The method is based on the feature frequency profiles (FFP), where the length of the feature (l-mer) is selected to be optimal for phylogenomic inference. We observe that (i) the FFP phylogeny segregates the population into clades, the membership of each has remarkable agreement with current classification by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses, with one exception that the mimivirus joins the phycodnavirus family; (ii) the FFP tree detects potential evolutionary relationships among some viral families; (iii) the relative position of the 3 herpesvirus subfamilies in the FFP tree differs from gene alignment-based analysis; (iv) the FFP tree suggests the taxonomic positions of certain "unclassified" viruses; and (v) the FFP method identifies candidates for horizontal gene transfer between virus families.},

Techniques for measuring and testing the significance of phylogenetic incongruence are used widely in systematic biology, and are necessary when considering genome-scale datasets composed of multiple genes that may or may not have different histories. They are also applicable wherever tree algorithms are used for ordering and interpreting data (e.g., DNA microarrays). Here, I review the different incongruence tests and use them to test the phylogenetic discord of a potentially mobile genetic element (the widespread colonization Island) in the gamma-proteobacteria. I then consider how incongruence tests may be used as a starting point for phylogenetic analysis that accounts for horizontal transfer and duplication events as explanations for homoplasy.},

	doi = {10.1093/molbev/msv266},
	abstract = {Phylogeneticists are increasingly assembling genome-scale data sets that include hundreds of genes to resolve their focal clades. Although these data sets commonly include a moderate to high amount of missing data, there remains no consensus on their impact to species tree estimation. Here, using several simulated and empirical data sets, we assess the effects of missing data on species tree estimation under varying degrees of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and gene rate heterogeneity. We demonstrate that concatenation (RAxML), gene-tree-based coalescent (ASTRAL, MP-EST, and STAR), and supertree (matrix representation with parsimony [MRP]) methods perform reliably, so long as missing data are randomly distributed (by gene and/or by species) and that a sufficiently large number of genes are sampled. When data sets are indecisive sensu Sanderson et al. (2010. Phylogenomics with incomplete taxon coverage: the limits to inference. BMC Evol Biol. 10:155) and/or ILS is high, however, high amounts of missing data that are randomly distributed require exhaustive levels of gene sampling, likely exceeding most empirical studies to date. Moreover, missing data become especially problematic when they are nonrandomly distributed. We demonstrate that STAR produces inconsistent results when the amount of nonrandom missing data is high, regardless of the degree of ILS and gene rate heterogeneity. Similarly, concatenation methods using maximum likelihood can be misled by nonrandom missing data in the presence of gene rate heterogeneity, which becomes further exacerbated when combined with high ILS. In contrast, ASTRAL, MP-EST, and MRP are more robust under all of these scenarios. These results underscore the importance of understanding the influence of missing data in the phylogenomics era.},

	abstract = {Large-scale multi-locus studies have become common in molecular phylogenetics, with new studies continually adding to previous datasets in an effort to fully resolve the tree of life. Total evidence analyses that combine existing data with newly collected data are expected to increase the power of phylogenetic analyses to resolve difficult relationships. However, they might be subject to localized biases, with one or a few loci having a strong and potentially misleading influence upon the results. To examine this possibility we combined a newly collected 31-locus dataset that includes representatives of all major avian lineages with a published dataset of 19 loci that has a comparable number of sites (Hackett et al., 2008. Science 320, 1763-1768). This allowed us to explore the advantages of conducting total evidence analyses, and to determine whether it was also important to analyze new datasets independent of published ones. The total evidence analysis yielded results very similar to the published results, with only slightly increased support at a few nodes. However, analyzing the 31- and 19-locus datasets separately highlighted several differences. Two clades received strong support in the published dataset and total evidence analysis, but the support appeared to reflect bias at a single locus (β-fibrinogen [FGB]). The signal in FGB that supported these relationships was sufficient to result in their recovery with bootstrap support, even when combined with 49 loci lacking that signal. FGB did not appear to have a substantial impact upon the results of species tree methods, but another locus (brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF]) did have an impact upon those analyses. These results demonstrated that localized biases can influence large-scale phylogenetic analyses but they also indicated that considering independent evidence and exploring multiple analytical approaches could reveal them.},

Here, we describe improvements to FastTree that improve its accuracy without sacrificing scalability. Where FastTree 1 used nearest-neighbor interchanges (NNIs) and the minimum-evolution criterion to improve the tree, FastTree 2 adds minimum-evolution subtree-pruning-regrafting (SPRs) and maximum-likelihood NNIs. FastTree 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better trees and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the âCATâ approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and genuine alignments, FastTree 2 is slightly more accurate than a standard implementation of maximum-likelihood NNIs (PhyML 3 with default settings). Although FastTree 2 is not quite as accurate as methods that use maximum-likelihood SPRs, most of the splits that disagree are poorly supported, and for large alignments, FastTree 2 is 100â1,000 times faster. FastTree 2 inferred a topology and likelihood-based local support values for 237,882 distinct 16S ribosomal RNAs on a desktop computer in 22 hours and 5.8 gigabytes of memory. FastTree 2 allows the inference of maximum-likelihood phylogenies for huge alignments. FastTree 2 is freely available at http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree.},

AB is a wrapper method that can be used with any learning algorithm. It establishes an appropriate attribute subset size and then randomly selects subsets of features, creating projections of the training set on which the ensemble classifiers are built. The induced classifiers are then used for voting. This article compares the performance of our AB method with bagging and other algorithms on a hand-pose recognition dataset. It is shown that AB gives consistently better results than bagging, both in accuracy and stability. The performance of ensemble voting in bagging and the AB method as a function of the attribute subset size and the number of voters for both weighted and unweighted voting is tested and discussed. We also demonstrate that ranking the attribute subsets by their classification accuracy and voting using only the best subsets further improves the resulting performance of the ensemble. ?? 2002 Pattern Recognition Society.

	abstract = {This article reviews the various models that have been used to describe the relationships between gene trees and species trees. Molecular phylogeny has focused mainly on improving models for the reconstruction of gene trees based on sequence alignments. Yet, most phylogeneticists seek to reveal the history of species. Although the histories of genes and species are tightly linked, they are seldom identical, because genes duplicate, are lost or horizontally transferred, and because alleles can co-exist in populations for periods that may span several speciation events. Building models describing the relationship between gene and species trees can thus improve the reconstruction of gene trees when a species tree is known, and vice-versa. Several approaches have been proposed to solve the problem in one direction or the other, but in general neither gene trees nor species trees are known. Only a few studies have attempted to jointly infer gene trees and species trees. These models account for gene duplication and loss, transfer or incomplete lineage sorting. Some of them consider several types of events together, but none exists currently that considers the full repertoire of processes that generate gene trees along the species tree. Simulations as well as empirical studies on genomic data show that combining gene tree-species tree models with models of sequence evolution improves gene tree reconstruction. In turn, these better gene trees provide a more reliable basis for studying genome evolution or reconstructing ancestral chromosomes and ancestral gene sequences. We predict that gene tree-species tree methods that can deal with genomic data sets will be instrumental to advancing our understanding of genomic evolution.},

The main result is that for any species-tree topology with seven or more taxa, there exist branch lengths such that there are unrooted gene-tree topologies that are more likely than the one that has the same unrooted topology as the species tree. Species trees with such anomalous unrooted gene trees (AUGTs) are characterized for trees with five and six taxa, and patterns of branch lengths leading to AUGTs and rooted anomalous gene trees are explored.

	abstract = {The timing of the evolution of microbial life has largely remained elusive due to the scarcity of prokaryotic fossil record and the confounding effects of the exchange of genes among possibly distant species. The history of gene transfer events, however, is not a series of individual oddities; it records which lineages were concurrent and thus provides information on the timing of species diversification. Here, we use a probabilistic model of genome evolution that accounts for differences between gene phylogenies and the species tree as series of duplication, transfer, and loss events to reconstruct chronologically ordered species phylogenies. Using simulations we show that we can robustly recover accurate chronologically ordered species phylogenies in the presence of gene tree reconstruction errors and realistic rates of duplication, transfer, and loss. Using genomic data we demonstrate that we can infer rooted species phylogenies using homologous gene families from complete genomes of 10 bacterial and archaeal groups. Focusing on cyanobacteria, distinguished among prokaryotes by a relative abundance of fossils, we infer the maximum likelihood chronologically ordered species phylogeny based on 36 genomes with 8,332 homologous gene families. We find the order of speciation events to be in full agreement with the fossil record and the inferred phylogeny of cyanobacteria to be consistent with the phylogeny recovered from established phylogenomics methods. Our results demonstrate that lateral gene transfers, detected by probabilistic models of genome evolution, can be used as a source of information on the timing of evolution, providing a valuable complement to the limited prokaryotic fossil record.},

	abstract = {The control, prediction, and understanding of epidemiological processes require insight into how infectious pathogens transmit in a population. The chain of transmission can in principle be reconstructed with phylogenetic methods which analyze the evolutionary history using pathogen sequence data. The quality of the reconstruction, however, crucially depends on the underlying epidemiological model used in phylogenetic inference. Until now, only simple epidemiological models have been used, which make limiting assumptions such as constant rate parameters, infinite total population size, or deterministically changing population size of infected individuals. Here, we present a novel phylogenetic method to infer parameters based on a classical stochastic epidemiological model. Specifically, we use the susceptible-infected-susceptible model, which accounts for density-dependent transmission rates and finite total population size, leading to a stochastically changing infected population size. We first validate our method by estimating epidemic parameters for simulated data and then apply it to transmission clusters from the Swiss HIV epidemic. Our estimates of the basic reproductive number R0 for the considered Swiss HIV transmission clusters are significantly higher than previous estimates, which were derived assuming infinite population size. This difference in key parameter estimates highlights the importance of careful model choice when doing phylogenetic inference. In summary, this article presents the first fully stochastic implementation of a classical epidemiological model for phylogenetic inference and thereby addresses a key aspect in ongoing efforts to merge phylogenetics and epidemiology.},

This sudden flood of data raises numerous challenges in data analysis and interpretation but also offers the keys to potential insights across large swathes of plant biology.

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btm226},
	abstract = {Motivation: Multiple sequence alignment is a fundamental task in bioinformatics. Current tools typically form an initial alignment by merging subalignments, and then polish this alignment by repeated splitting and merging of subalignments to obtain an improved final alignment. In general this form-and-polish strategy consists of several stages, and a profusion of methods have been tried at every stage. We carefully investigate: (1) how to utilize a new algorithm for aligning alignments that optimally solves the common subproblem of merging subalignments, and (2) what is the best choice of method for each stage to obtain the highest quality alignment. Results: We study six stages in the form-and-polish strategy for multiple alignment: parameter choice, distance estimation, merge-tree construction, sequence-pair weighting, alignment merging, and polishing. For each stage, we consider novel approaches as well as standard ones. Interestingly, the greatest gains in alignment quality come from (i) estimating distances by a new approach using normalized alignment costs, and (ii) polishing by a new approach using 3-cuts. Experiments with a parameter-value oracle suggest large gains in quality may be possible through an input-dependent choice of alignment parameters, and we present a promising approach for building such an oracle. Combining the best approaches to each stage yields a new tool we call Opal that on benchmark alignments matches the quality of the top tools, without employing alignment consistency or hydrophobic gap penalties.

	abstract = {Sequence alignment underpins all of comparative genomics, yet it remains an incompletely solved problem. In particular, the statistical uncertainty within inferred alignments is often disregarded, while parametric or phylogenetic inferences are considered meaningless without confidence estimates. Here, we report on a theoretical and simulation study of pairwise alignments of genomic DNA at human-mouse divergence. We find that {\textgreater}15\% of aligned bases are incorrect in existing whole-genome alignments, and we identify three types of alignment error, each leading to systematic biases in all algorithms considered. Careful modeling of the evolutionary process improves alignment quality; however, these improvements are modest compared with the remaining alignment errors, even with exact knowledge of the evolutionary model, emphasizing the need for statistical approaches to account for uncertainty. We develop a new algorithm, Marginalized Posterior Decoding (MPD), which explicitly accounts for uncertainties, is less biased and more accurate than other algorithms we consider, and reduces the proportion of misaligned bases by a third compared with the best existing algorithm. To our knowledge, this is the first nonheuristic algorithm for DNA sequence alignment to show robust improvements over the classic Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. Despite this, considerable uncertainty remains even in the improved alignments. We conclude that a probabilistic treatment is essential, both to improve alignment quality and to quantify the remaining uncertainty. This is becoming increasingly relevant with the growing appreciation of the importance of noncoding DNA, whose study relies heavily on alignments. Alignment errors are inevitable, and should be considered when drawing conclusions from alignments.

This paper proposes a novel approach for selecting and ordering a predetermined number of test cases from an existing test suite. Our approach forms an Integer Linear Programming problem using two different coverage-based criteria, and uses constraint relaxation to find many close-to-optimal solution points. These points are then combined to obtain a final solution using a voting mechanism. The selected subset of test cases is then prioritized using a greedy algorithm that maximizes minimum coverage in an iterative manner. The proposed approach has been empirically evaluated and the results show significant improvements over existing approaches for some cases and comparable results for the rest. Moreover, our approach provides more consistency compared to existing approaches. © 2012 IEEE.},

The bias can lead to high bootstrap, SH-like aLRT support (up to 100\%), and posterior probabilities for the conflicting clades. The bias can occur even when only a single terminal has missing data. The bias is not limited to likelihood methods that only ever present a single optimal tree that is fully resolved (as in PhyML and RAxML)-it can also occur in branch-and-bound PAUP* searches. The bias persists despite sampling numerous characters, and the bias is consistently unidirectional. The bias may occur in the context of incongruence between gene trees as well as within a single gene wherein terminals have different sequence lengths caused by DNA-amplification differences or gaps caused by indels. This bias is another example wherein commonly implemented parametric phylogenetic methods interpret ambiguity as support. In contrast, parsimony is robust to the bias.},

However, there are well over 1500 Mendelian disorders whose molecular basis remains unknown. At present, methods such as linkage analysis can identify the chromosomal region in which unknown disease genes are located, but the regions could contain up to hundreds of candidate genes. In this work, we present a method for prioritization of candidate genes by use of a global network distance measure, random walk analysis, for definition of similarities in protein-protein interaction networks. We tested our method on 110 disease-gene families with a total of 783 genes and achieved an area under the ROC curve of up to 98\% on simulated linkage intervals of 100 genes surrounding the disease gene, significantly outperforming previous methods based on local distance measures. Our results not only provide an improved tool for positional-cloning projects but also add weight to the assumption that phenotypically similar diseases are associated with disturbances of subnetworks within the larger protein interactome that extend beyond the disease proteins themselves. © 2008 The American Society of Human Genetics.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: HIV evolves rapidly at the epidemiological level but also at the within-host level. The virus' within-host evolutionary rates have been argued to be much higher than its between-host evolutionary rates. However, this conclusion relies on analyses of a short portion of the virus envelope gene. Here, we study in detail these evolutionary rates across the HIV genome. RESULTS: We build phylogenies using a relaxed molecular clock assumption to estimate evolutionary rates in different regions of the HIV genome. We find that these rates vary strongly across the genome, with higher rates in the envelope gene (env). Within-host evolutionary rates are consistently higher than between-host rates throughout the HIV genome. This difference is significantly more pronounced in env. Finally, we find weak differences between overlapping and non-overlapping regions. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a genome-wide overview of the differences in the HIV rates of molecular evolution at the within- and between-host levels. Contrary to hepatitis C virus, where differences are only located in the envelope gene, within-host evolutionary rates are higher than between-host evolutionary rates across the whole HIV genome. This supports the hypothesis that HIV strains that are less adapted to the host have an advantage during transmission. The most likely mechanism for this is storage and then preferential transmission of viruses in latent T-cells. These results shed a new light on the role of the transmission bottleneck in the evolutionary dynamics of HIV.},

Systematic error can be mitigated by improving models of sequence evolution to account for all evolutionary processes relevant to each gene or identifying those genes whose evolution best conforms to existing models. However, the best method for identifying such genes is not well established. Here, we ask if filtering genes according to their clock-likeness or posterior predictive effect size (PPES, an inference-based measure of model violation) improves phylogenetic reliability and congruence. We compared these approaches to each other, and to the common practice of filtering based on rate of evolution, using two different metrics. First, we compared gene-tree topologies to accepted reference topologies. Second, we examined topological similarity among gene trees in filtered sets. Our results suggest that filtering genes based on clock-likeness and PPES can yield a collection of genes with more reliable phylogenetic signal. For the two exemplar data sets we explored, from yeast and amniotes, clock-likeness and PPES outperformed rate-based filtering in both congruence and reliability.},

Two thresholds of single-gene divergence have been proposed: reciprocal monophyly, and 10 times greater genetic divergence between than within species (the GÇ£10+ù ruleGÇ¥). To explore quantitatively the utility of each approach, we couple neutral coalescent theory and the classical Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller (BDM) model of speciation. The joint stochastic dynamics of these two processes demonstrate that both thresholds fail to GÇ£discoverGÇ¥ many reproductively isolated lineages under a single incompatibility BDM model, especially when BDM loci have been subject to divergent selection. Only when populations have been isolated for {\textgreater} 4 million generations did these thresholds achieve error rates of {\textless} 10\% under our model that incorporates variable population sizes. The high error rate evident in simulations is corroborated with six empirical data sets. These properties suggest that single-gene, high-throughput approaches to discovering new animal species will bias large-scale biodiversity surveys, particularly toward missing reproductively isolated lineages that have emerged by divergent selection or other mechanisms that accelerate reproductive isolation. Because single-gene thresholds for species discovery can result in substantial error at recent divergence times, they will misrepresent the correspondence between recently isolated populations and reproductively isolated lineages (= species).},

In recent years, the field has witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of methods available for delimiting species. However, most recent investigations only utilize a handful (i.e. 2-3) of the available methods, often for unstated reasons. Because the parameter space that is potentially relevant to species delimitation far exceeds the parameterization of any existing method, a given method necessarily makes a number of simplifying assumptions, any one of which could be violated in a particular system. We suggest that researchers should apply a wide range of species delimitation analyses to their data and place their trust in delimitations that are congruent across methods. Incongruence across the results from different methods is evidence of either a difference in the power to detect cryptic lineages across one or more of the approaches used to delimit species and could indicate that assumptions of one or more of the methods have been violated. In either case, the inferences drawn from species delimitation studies should be conservative, for in most contexts it is better to fail to delimit species than it is to falsely delimit entities that do not represent actual evolutionary lineages.},

We have examined the genetic basis of hybrid sterility and female species preferences in Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila persimilis, two occasionally hybridizing North American species. Contrary to findings in other species groups, very few regions of the genome were associated with these characters, and these regions are associated also with fixed arrangement differences (inversions) between these species. From our results, we propose a preliminary genic model whereby inversions may contribute to the speciation process, thereby explaining the abundance of arrangement differences between closely related species that co-occur geographically. We suggest that inversions create linkage groups that cause sterility to persist between hybridizing taxa. The maintenance of this sterility allows the species to persist in the face of gene flow longer than without such inversions, and natural selection will have a greater opportunity to decrease the frequency of interspecies matings.},

We analyze the performance of DCM-boosted distance methods under the Jukes-Cantor Markov model of biomolecular sequence evolution, and prove that for almost all trees, polylogarithmic length sequences suffice for complete accuracy with high probability, while polynomial length sequences always suffice.

Restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) methods are becoming increasingly popular for SNP data collection, but an assessment of the best practices for using these data in phylogenetics is lacking. We use computer simulations, and new double digest RADseq (ddRADseq) data for the lizard family Phrynosomatidae, to investigate the accuracy of RAD loci for phylogenetic inference. We compare the two primary ways RAD loci are used during phylogenetic analysis, including the analysis of full sequences (i.e., SNPs together with invariant sites), or the analysis of SNPs on their own after excluding invariant sites. We find that using full sequences rather than just SNPs is preferable from the perspectives of branch length and topological accuracy, but not of computational time. We introduce two new acquisition bias corrections for dealing with alignments composed exclusively of SNPs, a conditional likelihood method and a reconstituted DNA approach. The conditional likelihood method conditions on the presence of variable characters only (the number of invariant sites that are unsampled but known to exist is not considered), while the reconstituted DNA approach requires the user to specify the exact number of unsampled invariant sites prior to the analysis. Under simulation, branch length biases increase with the amount of missing data for both acquisition bias correction methods, but branch length accuracy is much improved in the reconstituted DNA approach compared to the conditional likelihood approach. Phylogenetic analyses of the empirical data using concatenation or a coalescent-based species tree approach provide strong support for many of the accepted relationships among phrynosomatid lizards, suggesting that RAD loci contain useful phylogenetic signal across a range of divergence times despite the presence of missing data. Phylogenetic analysis of RAD loci requires careful attention to model assumptions, especially if downstream analyses depend on branch lengths.},

These models generally assume that rates randomly fluctuate along branches from one node to the next. However, for mathematical convenience, the stochasticity of such a process is ignored when translating these rate trajectories into branch lengths. This study addresses this shortcoming. A new approach is described that explicitly considers the average substitution rates along branches as random quantities, resulting in a more realistic description of the variations of evolutionary rates along lineages. The proposed method provides more precise estimates of the rate autocorrelation parameter as well as divergence times. Also, simulation results indicate that ignoring the stochastic variation of rates along edges can lead to significant overestimation of specific node ages. Altogether, the new approach introduced in this study is a step forward to designing biologically relevant models of rate evolution that are well suited to data sets with dense taxon sampling which are likely to present rate autocorrelation.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Natural acquisition of novel genes from other organisms by horizontal or lateral gene transfer is well established for microorganisms. There is now growing evidence that horizontal gene transfer also plays important roles in the evolution of eukaryotes. Genome-sequencing and EST projects of plant and animal associated nematodes such as Brugia, Meloidogyne, Bursaphelenchus and Pristionchus indicate horizontal gene transfer as a key adaptation towards parasitism and pathogenicity. However, little is known about the functional activity and evolutionary longevity of genes acquired by horizontal gene transfer and the mechanisms favoring such processes.

RESULTS: We examine the transfer of cellulase genes to the free-living and beetle-associated nematode Pristionchus pacificus, for which detailed phylogenetic knowledge is available, to address predictions by evolutionary theory for successful gene transfer. We used transcriptomics in seven Pristionchus species and three other related diplogastrid nematodes with a well-defined phylogenetic framework to study the evolution of ancestral cellulase genes acquired by horizontal gene transfer. We performed intra-species, inter-species and inter-genic analysis by comparing the transcriptomes of these ten species and tested for cellulase activity in each species. Species with cellulase genes in their transcriptome always exhibited cellulase activity indicating functional integration into the host's genome and biology. The phylogenetic profile of cellulase genes was congruent with the species phylogeny demonstrating gene longevity. Cellulase genes show notable turnover with elevated birth and death rates. Comparison by sequencing of three selected cellulase genes in 24 natural isolates of Pristionchus pacificus suggests these high evolutionary dynamics to be associated with copy number variations and positive selection.

CONCLUSION: We could demonstrate functional integration of acquired cellulase genes into the nematode's biology as predicted by theory. Thus, functional assimilation, remarkable gene turnover and selection might represent key features of horizontal gene transfer events in nematodes.},

However, the composition of modern-day genomes may bear imprints of ancient biogeochemical events. Here we use an explicit model of macroevolution including gene birth, transfer, duplication and loss events to map the evolutionary history of 3,983 gene families across the three domains of life onto a geological timeline. Surprisingly, we find that a brief period of genetic innovation during the Archaean eon, which coincides with a rapid diversification of bacterial lineages, gave rise to 27\% of major modern gene families. A functional analysis of genes born during this Archaean expansion reveals that they are likely to be involved in electron-transport and respiratory pathways. Genes arising after this expansion show increasing use of molecular oxygen (P = 3.4 × 10(-8)) and redox-sensitive transition metals and compounds, which is consistent with an increasingly oxygenating biosphere.},

	abstract = {Frogs (Anura) are one of the most diverse groups of vertebrates and comprise nearly 90\% of living amphibian species. Their worldwide distribution and diverse biology make them well-suited for assessing fundamental questions in evolution, ecology, and conservation. However, despite their scientific importance, the evolutionary history and tempo of frog diversification remain poorly understood. By using a molecular dataset of unprecedented size, including 88-kb characters from 95 nuclear genes of 156 frog species, in conjunction with 20 fossil-based calibrations, our analyses result in the most strongly supported phylogeny of all major frog lineages and provide a timescale of frog evolution that suggests much younger divergence times than suggested by earlier studies. Unexpectedly, our divergence-time analyses show that three species-rich clades (Hyloidea, Microhylidae, and Natatanura), which together comprise ∼88\% of extant anuran species, simultaneously underwent rapid diversification at the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary (KPB). Moreover, anuran families and subfamilies containing arboreal species originated near or after the KPB. These results suggest that the K-Pg mass extinction may have triggered explosive radiations of frogs by creating new ecological opportunities. This phylogeny also reveals relationships such as Microhylidae being sister to all other ranoid frogs and African continental lineages of Natatanura forming a clade that is sister to a clade of Eurasian, Indian, Melanesian, and Malagasy lineages. Biogeographical analyses suggest that the ancestral area of modern frogs was Africa, and their current distribution is largely associated with the breakup of Pangaea and subsequent Gondwanan fragmentation.},

	abstract = {Forward-in-time models of diversification (i.e.,speciation and extinction) produce phylogenetic trees that grow "vertically" as time goes by. Pruning the extinct lineages out of such trees leads to natural models for reconstructed trees (i.e.,phylogenies of extant species). Alternatively, reconstructed trees can be modelled by coalescent point processes (CPPs), where trees grow "horizontally" by the sequential addition of vertical edges. Each new edge starts at some random speciation time and ends at the present time; speciation times are drawn from the same distribution independently. CPPs lead to extremely fast computation of tree likelihoods and simulation of reconstructed trees. Their topology always follows the uniform distribution on ranked tree shapes (URT).We characterize which forward-in-time models lead to URT reconstructed trees and among these, which lead to CPP reconstructed trees. We show that for any "asymmetric" diversification model in which speciation rates only depend on time and extinction rates only depend on time and on a non-heritable trait (e.g.,age), the reconstructed tree is CPP, even if extant species are incompletely sampled. If rates additionally depend on the number of species, the reconstructed tree is (only) URT (but not CPP). We characterize the common distribution of speciation times in the CPP description, and discuss incomplete species sampling as well as three special model cases in detail: (1) the extinction rate does not depend on a trait; (2) rates do not depend on time; (3) mass extinctions may happen additionally at certain points in the past. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {We describe new methods for characterizing gene tree discordance in phylogenomic data sets, which screen for deviations from neutral expectations, summarize variation in statistical support among gene trees, and allow comparison of the patterns of discordance induced by various analysis choices. Using an exceptionally complete set of genome sequences for the short arm of chromosome 3 in Oryza (rice) species, we applied these methods to identify the causes and consequences of differing patterns of discordance in the sets of gene trees inferred using a panel of 20 distinct analysis pipelines. We found that discordance patterns were strongly affected by aspects of data selection, alignment, and alignment masking. Unusual patterns of discordance evident when using certain pipelines were reduced or eliminated by using alternative pipelines, suggesting that they were the product of methodological biases rather than evolutionary processes. In some cases, once such biases were eliminated, evolutionary processes such as introgression could be implicated. Additionally, patterns of gene tree discordance had significant downstream impacts on species tree inference. For example, inference from supermatrices was positively misleading when pipelines that led to biased gene trees were used. Several results may generalize to other data sets: we found that gene tree and species tree inference gave more reasonable results when intron sequence was included during sequence alignment and tree inference, the alignment software PRANK was used, and detectable "block-shift" alignment artifacts were removed. We discuss our findings in the context of well-established relationships in Oryza and continuing controversies regarding the domestication history of O. sativa.},

Previous analyses have found support for all three hypotheses, leading some to conclude that this phylogenetic problem might be impossible to resolve, due to the compounded effects of Incomplete Lineage Sorting (ILS) and a rapid radiation. Here we show, using a genome scale nucleotide dataset, microRNAs, and the reanalysis of the three largest previously published amino-acid datasets, that the root of Placentalia lies between Atlantogenata and Boreoeutheria. Although we found evidence for ILS in early placental evolution, we are able to reject previous conclusions that the placental root is a hard polytomy that cannot be resolved. Reanalyses of previous datasets recover Atlantogenata + Boreoeutheria and show that contradictory results are a consequence of poorly fitting evolutionary models; instead, when the evolutionary process is better-modelled, all datasets converge on Atlantogenata. Our Bayesian molecular clock analysis estimates that marsupials diverged from placentals 157-170 Ma, crown Placentalia diverged 86-100 Ma, and crown Atlantogenata diverged 84-97 Ma. Our results are compatible with placental diversification being driven by dispersal rather than vicariance mechanisms, postdating early phases in the protracted opening of the Atlantic Ocean.},

Using HIV-1 as an example of a model evolutionary system, we consider how population structure affects the shape and the structure of a viral phylogeny in the absence of strong selection at the population level. For structured populations, the number of lineages as a function of time is insufficient to describe the shape of the phylogeny. We develop deterministic approximations for the dynamics of tips of the phylogeny over evolutionary time, the number of 'cherries', tips that share a direct common ancestor, and Sackin's index, a commonly used measure of phylogenetic imbalance or asymmetry. We employ cherries both as a measure of asymmetry of the tree as well as a measure of the association between sequences from different groups. We consider heterogeneity in infectiousness associated with different stages of HIV infection, and in contact rates between groups of individuals. In the absence of selection, we find that population structure may have relatively little impact on the overall asymmetry of a tree, especially when only a small fraction of infected individuals is sampled, but may have marked effects on how sequences from different subpopulations cluster and co-cluster.},

Using this strategy, I create an evolutionary model for influenza nucleoprotein that describes the gene phylogeny far better than existing models with dozens or even hundreds of free parameters.

	abstract = {Stenonema, Stenacron, and Maccaffertium are three closely related genera of mayflies (Ephemeroptera:Heptageniidae) commonly found across North America. Due to their primarily aquatic life history and sensitivity to aquatic pollutants, these mayflies are often used as water quality indicators. However, there is little morphological variation within these genera, leading to difficulties in identification and rampant taxonomic confusion, limiting their utility as bioindicators. In an attempt to resolve the phylogenetic relationships of Stenonema, Stenacron, and Maccaffertium, and to clarify their higher-level classifications, we sequenced regions of two mitochondrial genes (cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) and 16S ribosomal RNA (rrnl)) and two nuclear genes (Wingless (Wg) and histone H3) from 60 individuals representing most of the described species in these genera and included data from representatives of three heptageniid genera (Kageronia, Macdunnoa and Pseudiron) proposed in previous studies to be closely related to our focal taxa as well as two more distantly related heptageniid genera (Epeorus and Heptagenia) to root the phylogenies. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian analysis were conducted on single-gene and concatenated multi-gene data sets and species tree methods were utilized to resolve relationships. These analyses resolved Stenacron as a monophyletic group sister to a clade comprising Macdunnoa, Maccaffertium and Stenonema. Maccaffertium was found to be paraphyletic, with Stenonema femoratum resolved within Maccaffertium as sister to M. mexicanum. Many relationships remained unresolved or varied across analyses, making revision of the classification based on phylogenetic considerations challenging. To minimize confusion while naming clades and acknowledging uncertainty in our phylogenetic conclusions, we redefine Stenonema to include Maccaffertium and propose three subgenera—Stenonema, Maccaffertium and Lewisa— for key well-supported clades.},

However, low-copy protein-coding nuclear genes have not been widely used on a large scale in spite of the advantages of their biparental inheritance and vast number of choices. Here, we identified 1083 highly conserved low-copy nuclear genes by genome comparison. Furthermore, we demonstrated the use of five nuclear genes in 91 angiosperms representing 46 orders (73\% of orders) and three gymnosperms as outgroups for a highly resolved phylogeny. These nuclear genes are easy to clone and align, and more phylogenetically informative than widely used organellar genes. The angiosperm phylogeny reconstructed using these genes was largely congruent with previous ones mainly inferred from organellar genes. Intriguingly, several new placements were uncovered for some groups, including those among the rosids, the asterids, and between the eudicots and several basal angiosperm groups. These conserved universal nuclear genes have several inherent qualities enabling them to be good markers for reconstructing angiosperm phylogeny, even eukaryotic relationships, further providing new insights into the evolutionary history of angiosperms.},

	abstract = {Recent analysis of complete eukaryotic genome sequences has revealed that gene duplication has been rampant. Moreover, next to a continuous mode of gene duplication, in many eukaryotic organisms the complete genome has been duplicated in their evolutionary past. Such large-scale gene duplication events have been associated with important evolutionary transitions or major leaps in development and adaptive radiations of species. Here, we present an evolutionary model that simulates the duplication dynamics of genes, considering genome-wide duplication events and a continuous mode of gene duplication. Modeling the evolution of the different functional categories of genes assesses the importance of different duplication events for gene families involved in specific functions or processes. By applying our model to the Arabidopsis genome, for which there is compelling evidence for three whole-genome duplications, we show that gene loss is strikingly different for large-scale and small-scale duplication events and highly biased toward certain functional classes. We provide evidence that some categories of genes were almost exclusively expanded through large-scale gene duplication events. In particular, we show that the three whole-genome duplications in Arabidopsis have been directly responsible for {\textgreater}90\% of the increase in transcription factors, signal transducers, and developmental genes in the last 350 million years. Our evolutionary model is widely applicable and can be used to evaluate different assumptions regarding small- or large-scale gene duplication events in eukaryotic genomes. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Previous studies have shown that analysis of concatenated data using maximum likelihood (ML) can produce misleading results when loci have differing gene tree topologies due to incomplete lineage sorting. Here, we develop a polynomial time method that utilizes the modified mincut supertree algorithm to construct an estimated species tree from inferred rooted triples of concatenated alignments. We term this method SuperMatrix Rooted Triple (SMRT) and use the notation SMRT-ML when rooted triples are inferred by ML. We use simulations to investigate the performance of SMRT-ML under Jukes-Cantor and general time-reversible substitution models for four- and five-taxon species trees and also apply the method to an empirical data set of yeast genes. We find that SMRT-ML converges to the correct species tree in many cases in which ML on the full concatenated data set fails to do so. SMRT-ML can be conservative in that its output tree is often partially unresolved for problematic clades. We show analytically that when the species tree is clocklike and mutations occur under the Cavender-Farris-Neyman substitution model, as the number of genes increases, SMRT-ML is increasingly likely to infer the correct species tree even when the most likely gene tree does not match the species tree. SMRT-ML is therefore a computationally efficient and statistically consistent estimator of the species tree when gene trees are distributed according to the multispecies coalescent model.},

	abstract = {Bayesian phylogenetic analyses are now very popular in systematics and molecular evolution because they allow the use of much more realistic models than currently possible with maximum likelihood methods. There are, however, a growing number of examples in which large Bayesian posterior clade probabilities are associated with very short branch lengths and low values for non-Bayesian measures of support such as nonparametric bootstrapping. For the four-taxon case when the true tree is the star phylogeny, Bayesian analyses become increasingly unpredictable in their preference for one of the three possible resolved tree topologies as data set size increases. This leads to the prediction that hard (or near-hard) polytomies in nature will cause unpredictable behavior in Bayesian analyses, with arbitrary resolutions of the polytomy receiving very high posterior probabilities in some cases. We present a simple solution to this problem involving a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that allows exploration of all of tree space, including unresolved tree topologies with one or more polytomies. The reversible-jump MCMC approach allows prior distributions to place some weight on less-resolved tree topologies, which eliminates misleadingly high posteriors associated with arbitrary resolutions of hard polytomies. Fortunately, assigning some prior probability to polytomous tree topologies does not appear to come with a significant cost in terms of the ability to assess the level of support for edges that do exist in the true tree. Methods are discussed for applying arbitrary prior distributions to tree topologies of varying resolution, and an empirical example showing evidence of polytomies is analyzed and discussed.},

We use Bayesian Belief Networks as a probabilistic tool to make such predictions in a systematic way. This novel technique mainly relies on two sources of information: dependency metrics (calculated using static analysis) and change history extracted from a version control repository. We evaluate our approach by examining all significant revisions of Azureus2, an open-source Java system.

We performed ultradeep sequencing (UDS) of partial HIV-1 gag, pol, and env genes from 32 recently infected individuals. We then evaluated overall and per-site diversity levels, selective pressure, sequence reproducibility, and presence of DRM and accessory mutations (AM). To differentiate biologically meaningful mutations from those caused by methodological errors, we obtained multinomial confidence intervals (CI) for the proportion of DRM at each site and fitted a binomial mixture model to determine background error rates for each sample. We then examined the association between detected minority DRM and the virologic failure of first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). Similar to other studies, we observed increased detection of DRM at low frequencies (average, 0.56\%; 95\% CI, 0.43 to 0.69; expected UDS error, 0.21 ± 0.08\% mutations/site). For 8 duplicate runs, there was variability in the proportions of minority DRM. There was no indication of increased diversity or selection at DRM sites compared to other sites and no association between minority DRM and AM. There was no correlation between detected minority DRM and clinical failure of first-line ART. It is unlikely that minority viral variants harboring DRM are transmitted and maintained in the recipient host. The majority of low-frequency DRM detected using UDS are likely errors inherent to UDS methodology or a consequence of error-prone HIV-1 replication.},

The parsimony criterion (equal weighting) favored the trees in which Amborella was sister to all other angiosperms, whereas the likelihood measure favored the trees in which the Amborella-Nymphaeales clade represented the first diverging lineage of angiosperms.

The clade of eumagnoliids, consisting of Winterales, Piperales, Magnoliales, and Laurales, was also consistently recovered in all of the analyses, albeit with low bootstrap support.

	abstract = {The Bioperl project is an international open-source collaboration of biologists, bioinformaticians, and computer scientists that has evolved over the past 7 yr into the most comprehensive library of Perl modules available for managing and manipulating life-science information. Bioperl provides an easy-to-use, stable, and consistent programming interface for bioinformatics application programmers. The Bioperl modules have been successfully and repeatedly used to reduce otherwise complex tasks to only a few lines of code. The Bioperl object model has been proven to be flexible enough to support enterprise-level applications such as EnsEMBL, while maintaining an easy learning curve for novice Perl programmers. Bioperl is capable of executing analyses and processing results from programs such as BLAST, ClustalW, or the EMBOSS suite. Interoperation with modules written in Python and Java is supported through the evolving BioCORBA bridge. Bioperl provides access to data stores such as GenBank and SwissProt via a flexible series of sequence input/output modules, and to the emerging common sequence data storage format of the Open Bioinformatics Database Access project. This study describes the overall architecture of the toolkit, the problem domains that it addresses, and gives specific examples of how the toolkit can be used to solve common life-sciences problems. We conclude with a discussion of how the open-source nature of the project has contributed to the development effort.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic analysis very commonly produces several alternative trees for a given fixed set of taxa. For example, different sets of orthologous genes may be analyzed, or the analysis may sample from a distribution of probable trees. This article describes an approach to comparing and visualizing multiple alternative phylogenies via the idea of a "tree of trees" or "meta-tree." A meta-tree clusters phylogenies with similar topologies together in the same way that a phylogeny clusters species with similar DNA sequences. Leaf nodes on a meta-tree correspond to the original set of phylogenies given by some analysis, whereas interior nodes correspond to certain consensus topologies. The construction of meta-trees is motivated by analogy with construction of a most parsimonious tree for DNA data, but instead of using DNA letters, in a meta-tree the characters are partitions or splits of the set of taxa. An efficient algorithm for meta-tree construction is described that makes use of a known relationship between the majority consensus and parsimony in terms of gain and loss of splits. To illustrate these ideas meta-trees are constructed for two datasets: a set of gene trees for species of yeast and trees from a bootstrap analysis of a set of gene trees in ray-finned fish. A software tool for constructing meta-trees and comparing alternative phylogenies is available online, and the source code can be obtained from the author.},

	abstract = {Phylogeny estimation is extremely crucial in the study of molecular evolution. The increase in the amount of available genomic data facilitates phylogeny estimation from multilocus sequence data. Although maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods are available for phylogeny reconstruction using multilocus sequence data, these methods require heavy computation, and their application is limited to the analysis of a moderate number of genes and taxa. Distance matrix methods present suitable alternatives for analyzing huge amounts of sequence data. However, the manner in which distance methods can be applied to multilocus sequence data remains unknown. Here, we suggest new procedures to estimate molecular phylogeny using multilocus sequence data and evaluate its significance in the framework of the distance method. We found that concatenation of the multilocus sequence data may result in incorrect phylogeny estimation with an extremely high bootstrap probability (BP), which is due to incorrect estimation of the distances and intentional ignorance of the intergene variations. Therefore, we suggest that the distance matrices for multilocus sequence data be estimated separately and these matrices be subsequently combined to reconstruct phylogeny instead of phylogeny reconstruction using concatenated sequence data. To calculate the BPs of the reconstructed phylogeny, we suggest that 2-stage bootstrap procedures be adopted; in this, genes are resampled followed by resampling of the sequence columns within the resampled genes. By resampling the genes during calculation of BPs, intergene variations are properly considered. Via simulation studies and empirical data analysis, we demonstrate that our 2-stage bootstrap procedures are more suitable than the conventional bootstrap procedure that is adopted after sequence concatenation.},

	abstract = {HIV-1 sequences in intravenous drug user (IDU) networks are highly homogenous even after several years, while this is not observed in most sexual epidemics. To address this disparity, we examined the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evolutionary rate on the population level for IDU and heterosexual transmissions. All available HIV-1 env V3 sequences from IDU outbreaks and heterosexual epidemics with known sampling dates were collected from the Los Alamos HIV sequence database. Evolutionary rates were calculated using phylogenetic trees with a t test root optimization of dated samples. The evolutionary rate of HIV-1 subtype A1 was found to be 8.4 times lower in fast spread among IDUs in the former Soviet Union (FSU) than in slow spread among heterosexual individuals in Africa. Mixed epidemics (IDU and heterosexual) showed intermediate evolutionary rates, indicating a combination of fast- and slow-spread patterns. Hence, if transmissions occur repeatedly during the initial stage of host infection, before selective pressures of the immune system have much impact, the rate of HIV-1 evolution on the population level will decrease. Conversely, in slow spread, where HIV-1 evolves under the pressure of the immune system before a donor infects a recipient, the virus evolution at the population level will increase. Epidemiological modeling confirmed that the evolutionary rate of HIV-1 depends on the rate of spread and predicted that the HIV-1 evolutionary rate in a fast-spreading epidemic, e.g., for IDUs in the FSU, will increase as the population becomes saturated with infections and the virus starts to spread to other risk groups.},

For rooting, polymorphic characters among the group of interest (ingroup) must be compared to those of a relative (outgroup) that diverged before the last common ancestor (LCA) of the ingroup. Problems arise if an outgroup does not exist, is unknown, or is so distant that few characters are shared, in which case duplicated genes originating before the LCA can be used as proxy outgroups to root diverse phylogenies. Here, we describe a genome-wide expansion of this technique that can be used to solve problems at the other end of the evolutionary scale: where ingroup individuals are all very closely related to each other, but the next closest relative is very distant. We used shared orthologous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 10 whole genome sequences of Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever in humans, to create a robust, but unrooted phylogeny. To maximize the number of characters informative about the rooting, we searched entire genomes for polymorphic duplicated regions where orthologs of each paralog could be identified so that the paralogs could be used to root the tree. Recent radiations, such as those of emerging pathogens, often pose rooting challenges due to a lack of ingroup variation and large genomic differences with known outgroups. Using a phylogenomic approach, we created a robust, rooted phylogeny for C. burnetii.

The molecular data group humans with chimpanzees in subtribe Hominina, with gorillas in tribe Hominini, orangutans in subfamily Homininae, gibbons in family Hominidae, Old World monkeys in infraorder Catarrhini, New World monkeys in semisuborder Anthropoidea, tarsiers in suborder Haplorhini, and strepsirhines (lemuriforms and lorisiforms) in order Primates.

It can also improve the assembly of fragmented genomes by proposing evolutionary-induced adjacencies between scaffolding fragments. Ancestral genes or domains are deduced from reconciled phylogenetic trees under an evolutionary model that considers gains, losses, speciations, duplications, and transfers as possible events for gene evolution. Reconciliations are either given as input or computed with the ecceTERA package, into which DeCoSTAR is integrated. DeCoSTAR computes adjacency evolutionary scenarios using a scoring scheme based on a weighted sum of adjacency gains and breakages. Solutions, both optimal and near-optimal, are sampled according to the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution centered around parsimonious solutions, and statistical supports on ancestral and extant adjacencies are provided. DeCoSTAR supports the features of previously-contributed tools that reconstruct ancestral adjacencies, namely DeCo, DeCoLT, ART-DeCo and DeClone. In a few minutes, DeCoSTAR can reconstruct the evolutionary history of domains inside genes, of gene fusion and fission events, or of gene order along chromosomes, for large data sets including dozens of whole genomes from all kingdoms of life. We illustrate the potential of DeCoSTAR with several applications: ancestral reconstruction of gene orders for Anopheles mosquito genomes, multidomain proteins in Drosophila, and gene fusion and fission detection in Actinobacteria.},

This makes the method more efficient than the usual ones in recovering phylogenetic trees from sequence data when base composition is heterogeneous within the data set, as we show by using both simulated and empirical data. When applied to small-subunit ribosomal RNA sequences from several prokaryotic or eukaryotic organisms, this method provides evidence for an early divergence of the microsporidian Vairimorpha necatrix in the eukaryotic lineage.},

	abstract = {Although an increasing number of phylogenetic data sets are incomplete, the effect of ambiguous data on phylogenetic accuracy is not well understood. We use 4-taxon simulations to study the effects of ambiguous data (i.e., missing characters or gaps) in maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian frameworks. By introducing ambiguous data in a way that removes confounding factors, we provide the first clear understanding of 1 mechanism by which ambiguous data can mislead phylogenetic analyses. We find that in both ML and Bayesian frameworks, among-site rate variation can interact with ambiguous data to produce misleading estimates of topology and branch lengths. Furthermore, within a Bayesian framework, priors on branch lengths and rate heterogeneity parameters can exacerbate the effects of ambiguous data, resulting in strongly misleading bipartition posterior probabilities. The magnitude and direction of the ambiguous data bias are a function of the number and taxonomic distribution of ambiguous characters, the strength of topological support, and whether or not the model is correctly specified. The results of this study have major implications for all analyses that rely on accurate estimates of topology or branch lengths, including divergence time estimation, ancestral state reconstruction, tree-dependent comparative methods, rate variation analysis, phylogenetic hypothesis testing, and phylogeographic analysis.},

Here we constructed a consensus unrooted archaeal topology using protein concatenation and a multigene supertree method based on 3,242 single gene trees, and then rooted this tree using a recently developed model of genome evolution. This model uses evidence from gene duplications, horizontal transfers, and gene losses contained in 31,236 archaeal gene families to identify the most likely root for the tree. Our analyses support the monophyly of DPANN (Diapherotrites, Parvarchaeota, Aenigmarchaeota, Nanoarchaeota, Nanohaloarchaea), a recently discovered cosmopolitan and genetically diverse lineage, and, in contrast to previouswork, place the tree root between DPANN and all other Archaea. The sister group to DPANN comprises the Euryarchaeota and the TACK Archaea, including Lokiarchaeum,which our analyses suggest are monophyletic sister lineages.Metabolic reconstructions on the rooted tree suggest that early Archaea were anaerobes that may have had the ability to reduce CO2 to acetate via the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway. In contrast to proposals suggesting that genome reduction has been the predominant mode of archaeal evolution, our analyses infer a relatively small-genomed archaeal ancestor that subsequently increased in complexity via gene duplication and horizontal gene transfer.},

The extraordinary genetic capacities of microbes have benefitted from man's overuse of antibiotics to exploit every source of resistance genes and every means of horizontal gene transmission to develop multiple mechanisms of resistance for each and every antibiotic introduced into practice clinically, agriculturally, or otherwise. This review presents the salient aspects of antibiotic resistance development over the past half-century, with the oft-restated conclusion that it is time to act. To achieve complete restitution of therapeutic applications of antibiotics, there is a need for more information on the role of environmental microbiomes in the rise of antibiotic resistance. In particular, creative approaches to the discovery of novel antibiotics and their expedited and controlled introduction to therapy are obligatory.},

	abstract = {Over calendar time, HIV-1 evolves considerably faster within individuals than it does at the epidemic level. This is a surprising observation since, from basic population genetic theory, we would expect the genetic substitution rate to be similar across different levels of biological organization. Three different mechanisms could potentially cause the observed mismatch in phylogenetic rates of divergence: temporal changes in selection pressure during the course of infection; frequent reversion of adaptive mutations after transmission; and the storage of the virus in the body followed by the preferential transmission of stored ancestral virus. We evaluate each of these mechanisms to determine whether they are likely to make a major contribution to the mismatch in phylogenetic rates. We conclude that the cycling of the virus through very long-lived memory CD4(+) T cells, a process that we call 'store and retrieve', is probably the major contributing factor to the rate mismatch. The preferential transmission of ancestral virus needs to be integrated into evolutionary models if we are to accurately predict the evolution of immune escape, drug resistance and virulence in HIV-1 at the population level. Moreover, early infection viruses should be the major target for vaccine design, because these are the viral strains primarily involved in transmission.},

We demonstrate that structural variants are enriched on haplotypes identified by genome-wide association studies and exhibit enrichment for expression quantitative trait loci. Additionally, we uncover appreciable levels of structural variant complexity at different scales, including genic loci subject to clusters of repeated rearrangement and complex structural variants with multiple breakpoints likely to have formed through individual mutational events.

Motivated by questions regarding historical biogeography or the mode of evolution, these works aimed to obtain a clearer scenario of Platyrrhini origins and diversification. Although some consensus was found, disputed issues, especially those relating to the evolutionary affinities of fossil taxa, remain. The use of fossil taxa for divergence time analysis is traditionally restricted to the provision of calibration priors. However, new analytical approaches have been developed that incorporate fossils as terminals and, thus, directly assign ages to the fossil tips. In this study, we conducted a combined analysis of molecular and morphological data, including fossils, to derive the timescale of New World anthropoids. Differently from previous studies that conducted total-evidence analysis of molecules and morphology, our approach investigated the morphological clock alone. Our results corroborate the hypothesis that living platyrrhines diversified in the last 20 Ma and that Miocene Patagonian fossils compose an independent evolutionary radiation that diversified in the late Oligocene. When compared to the node ages inferred from the molecular timescale, the inclusion of fossils augmented the precision of the estimates for nodes constrained by the fossil tips. We show that morphological data can be analysed using the same methodological framework applied in relaxed molecular clock studies.},

This alga shows an enormous metabolic flexibility, growing either photoautotrophically or heterotrophically on more than 50 carbon sources. Environmental adaptation seems to have been facilitated by horizontal gene transfer from various bacteria and archaea, often followed by gene family expansion. At least 5\% of protein-coding genes of G. sulphuraria were probably acquired horizontally. These proteins are involved in ecologically important processes ranging from heavy-metal detoxification to glycerol uptake and metabolism.

These gene fragments (environmental gene tags, EGTs), are classified into a higher-order taxonomy based on the reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree of each matching Pfam family. The method exhibits high accuracy for a wide range of taxonomic groups, and EGTs as short as 27 amino acids can be phylogenetically classified up to the rank of genus.

	abstract = {Most current models of sequence evolution assume that all sites of a protein evolve under the same substitution process, characterized by a 20 x 20 substitution matrix. Here, we propose to relax this assumption by developing a Bayesian mixture model that allows the amino-acid replacement pattern at different sites of a protein alignment to be described by distinct substitution processes. Our model, named CAT, assumes the existence of distinct processes (or classes) differing by their equilibrium frequencies over the 20 residues. Through the use of a Dirichlet process prior, the total number of classes and their respective amino-acid profiles, as well as the affiliations of each site to a given class, are all free variables of the model. In this way, the CAT model is able to adapt to the complexity actually present in the data, and it yields an estimate of the substitutional heterogeneity through the posterior mean number of classes. We show that a significant level of heterogeneity is present in the substitution patterns of proteins, and that the standard one-matrix model fails to account for this heterogeneity. By evaluating the Bayes factor, we demonstrate that the standard model is outperformed by CAT on all of the data sets which we analyzed. Altogether, these results suggest that the complexity of the pattern of substitution of real sequences is better captured by the CAT model, offering the possibility of studying its impact on phylogenetic reconstruction and its connections with structure-function determinants.},

	abstract = {During the several-week course of an immune response, B cells undergo a process of clonal expansion, somatic hypermutation of the immunoglobulin (Ig) genes and affinity-dependent selection. Over a lifetime, each B cell may participate in multiple rounds of affinity maturation as part of different immune responses. These two time-scales for selection are apparent in the structure of B-cell lineage trees, which often contain a 'trunk' consisting of mutations that are shared across all members of a clone, and several branches that form a 'canopy' consisting of mutations that are shared by a subset of clone members. The influence of affinity maturation on the B-cell population can be inferred by analysing the pattern of somatic mutations in the Ig. While global analysis of mutation patterns has shown evidence of strong selection pressures shaping the B-cell population, the effect of different time-scales of selection and diversification has not yet been studied. Analysis of B cells from blood samples of three healthy individuals identifies a range of clone sizes with lineage trees that can contain long trunks and canopies indicating the significant diversity introduced by the affinity maturation process. We here show that observed mutation patterns in the framework regions (FWRs) are determined by an almost purely purifying selection on both short and long time-scales. By contrast, complementarity determining regions (CDRs) are affected by a combination of purifying and antigen-driven positive selection on the short term, which leads to a net positive selection in the long term. In both the FWRs and CDRs, long-term selection is strongly dependent on the heavy chain variable gene family.},

We have used the CE structure alignment program (Shindyalov and Bourne, Prot Eng 1998;11: 739) to derive sequence alignments for all superfamily and family-level related proteins in the SCOP domain database. CE aligns structures and their sequences based on distances within each protein, rather than on interprotein distances. We compared BLAST, PSI-BLAST, CLUSTALW, and ISS alignments with the CE structural alignments. We found that global alignments with CLUSTALW were very poor at low sequence identity (\&lt;25\%), as judged by the CE alignments. We used PSI-BLAST to search the nonredundant sequence database (nr) with every sequence in SCOP using up to four iterations. The resulting matrix was used to search a database of SCOP sequences. PSI-BLAST is only slightly better than BLAST in alignment accuracy on a perresidue basis, but PSI-BLAST matrix alignments are much longer than BLAST\&\#039;s, and so align correctly a larger fraction of the total number of aligned residues in the structure alignments. Any two SCOP sequences in the same superfamily that shared a hit or hits in the nr PSI-BLAST searches were identified as linked by the shared intermediate sequence. We examined the quality of the longest SCOP-query/ SCOP-hit alignment via an intermediate sequence, and found that ISS produced longer alignments than PSI-BLAST searches alone, of nearly comparable per-residue quality. At 10--15\% sequence identity, BLAST correctly aligns 28\%, PSI-BLAST 40\%, and ISS ...},

The properties studied include the mean and variance for several underlying distributions of trees, the range, the effect of the number of taxa, and methods of calculation. Three basic theorems and their proofs are reported, one for each class of tree comparison metric. The partition metric generates an asymptotic Poisson distribution for most distributions of trees (its mean is given for three tree distributions). Exact expressions are derived for the variance of the quartet metric and the mean square value of a metric based on path differences. Factors that affect the choice of a metric for a particular study include the degree of similarity of the trees being compared and the type of hypothesis being tested (e.g., whether the trees estimate the same underlying phylogeny or are simply related in some, perhaps unknown, way).},

	abstract = {Distances between sequences based on their \$k\$-mer frequency counts can be used to reconstruct phylogenies without first computing a sequence alignment. Past work has shown that effective use of k-mer methods depends on 1) model-based corrections to distances based on \$k\$-mers and 2) breaking long sequences into blocks to obtain repeated trials from the sequence-generating process. Good performance of such methods is based on having many high-quality blocks with many homologous sites, which can be problematic to guarantee a priori. Nature provides natural blocks of sequences into homologous regions---namely, the genes. However, directly using past work in this setting is problematic because of possible discordance between different gene trees and the underlying species tree. Using the multispecies coalescent model as a basis, we derive model-based moment formulas that involve the divergence times and the coalescent parameters. From this setting, we prove identifiability results for the tree and branch length parameters under the Jukes-Cantor model of sequence mutations.},

	doi = {10.1093/sysbio/syt108},
	abstract = {Since the advent of molecular phylogenetics more than 25 years ago, a major goal of plant systematists has been to discern the root of the angiosperms. Although most studies indicate that Amborella trichopoda is sister to all remaining extant flowering plants, support for this position has varied with respect to both the sequence data sets and analyses employed. Recently, Goremykin et al. (2013) questioned the “Amborella-sister hypothesis” using a “noise-reduction” approach and reported a topology with Amborella + Nymphaeales (water lilies) sister to all remaining angiosperms. Through a series of analyses of both plastid genomes and mitochondrial genes, we continue to find mostly strong support for the Amborella-sister hypothesis and offer a rebuttal of Goremykin et al. (2013). The major tenet of Goremykin et al. is that the Amborella-sister position is determined by noisy data—that is, characters with high rates of change and lacking true phylogenetic signal. To investigate the signal in these noisy data further, we analyzed the discarded characters from their noise-reduced alignments. We recovered a tree identical to that of the currently accepted angiosperm framework, including the position of Amborella as sister to all other angiosperms, as well as all other major clades. Thus, the signal in the “noisy” data is consistent with that of our complete data sets—arguing against the use of their noise-reduction approach. We also determined that one of the alignments presented by Goremykin et al. yields results at odds with their central claim—their data set actually supports Amborella as sister to all other angiosperms, as do larger plastid data sets we present here that possess more complete taxon sampling both within the monocots and for angiosperms in general. Previous unpartitioned, multilocus analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data have provided the strongest support for Amborella + Nymphaeales as sister to other angiosperms. However, our analysis of third codon positions from mtDNA sequence data also supports the Amborella-sister hypothesis. Finally, we challenge the conclusion of Goremykin et al. that the first flowering plants were aquatic and herbaceous, reasserting that even if Amborella + water lilies, or water lilies alone, are sister to the rest of the angiosperms, the earliest angiosperms were not necessarily aquatic and/or herbaceous.

One fern-specific gene that we identified, recently shown to confer high insect resistance, seems to have been derived from bacteria through horizontal gene transfer. Azolla coexists in a unique symbiosis with N2-fixing cyanobacteria, and we demonstrate a clear pattern of cospeciation between the two partners. Furthermore, the Azolla genome lacks genes that are common to arbuscular mycorrhizal and root nodule symbioses, and we identify several putative transporter genes specific to Azolla–cyanobacterial symbiosis.

	abstract = {Transmission lies at the interface of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evolution within and among hosts and separates distinct selective pressures that impose differences in both the mode of diversification and the tempo of evolution. In the absence of comprehensive direct comparative analyses of the evolutionary processes at different biological scales, our understanding of how fast within-host HIV-1 evolutionary rates translate to lower rates at the between host level remains incomplete. Here, we address this by analyzing pol and env data from a large HIV-1 subtype C transmission chain for which both the timing and the direction is known for most transmission events. To this purpose, we develop a new transmission model in a Bayesian genealogical inference framework and demonstrate how to constrain the viral evolutionary history to be compatible with the transmission history while simultaneously inferring the within-host evolutionary and population dynamics. We show that accommodating a transmission bottleneck affords the best fit our data, but the sparse within-host HIV-1 sampling prevents accurate quantification of the concomitant loss in genetic diversity. We draw inference under the transmission model to estimate HIV-1 evolutionary rates among epidemiologically-related patients and demonstrate that they lie in between fast intra-host rates and lower rates among epidemiologically unrelated individuals infected with HIV subtype C. Using a new molecular clock approach, we quantify and find support for a lower evolutionary rate along branches that accommodate a transmission event or branches that represent the entire backbone of transmitted lineages in our transmission history. Finally, we recover the rate differences at the different biological scales for both synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates, which is only compatible with the 'store and retrieve' hypothesis positing that viruses stored early in latently infected cells preferentially transmit or establish new infections upon reactivation.},

A group of elongate-bodied genera are placed as basal among the dendryphantines, and previously proposed relationships of Poultonella, Paraphidippus, and Sassacus vitis are confirmed. Comparison of overall rates of molecular evolution indicates striking differences across the gene regions, with highest divergence in ND1, CO1, 16S, and 28S in decreasing order. All four regions are characterized by both within- and among-site rate variation.

Results support the temporal-focus hypothesis, demonstrating that the space-time mappings in people’s minds are conditioned by their cultural attitudes toward time, that they depend on attentional focus, and that they can vary independently of the space-time mappings enshrined in language.

Unfortunately, most museum specimens yield low-quality DNA. Recent advances in sequencing technologies, so called next-generation sequencing, are revolutionizing phylogenetic investigations at a deep level. Here, the Illumina technology (HiSeq) was used on herbarium specimens of Sartidia (subfamily Aristidoideae, Poaceae), a small African-Malagasy grass lineage (six species) characteristic of wooded savannas, which is the C3 sister group of Stipagrostis, an important C4 genus from Africa and SW Asia. Complete chloroplast and nuclear ribosomal sequences were assembled for two Sartidia species, one of which (S. perrieri) is only known from a single specimen collected in Madagascar 100 years ago. Partial sequences of a few single-copy genes encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylases (ppc) and malic enzymes (nadpme) were also assembled. Based on these data, the phylogenetic position of Malagasy Sartidia in the subfamily Aristidoideae was investigated and the biogeographical history of this genus was analysed with full species sampling. The evolutionary history of two genes for C4 photosynthesis (ppc-aL1b and nadpme-IV) in the group was also investigated. The gene encoding the C4 phosphoenolpyruvate caroxylase of Stipagrostis is absent from S. dewinteri suggesting that it is not essential in C3 members of the group, which might have favoured its recruitment into a new metabolic pathway. Altogether, the inclusion of historical museum specimens in phylogenomic analyses of biodiversity opens new avenues for evolutionary studies.},

	abstract = {Quantitative and continuous characters have rarely been included in cladistic analyses of morphological data; when included, they have always been discretized, using a variety of ad hoc methods. As continuous characters are typically additive, they can be optimized with well known algorithms, so that with a proper implementation they could be easily analyzed without discretization. The program TNT has recently incorporated algorithms for analysis of continuous characters. One of the problems that has been pointed out with existing methods for discretization is that they can attribute different states to terminals that do not differ significantly—or vice versa. With the implementation in TNT, this problem is diminished (or avoided entirely) by simply assigning to each terminal a range that goes from the mean minus one (or two) SE to the mean plus one (or two) SE; given normal distributions, terminals that do not overlap thus differ significantly (more significantly if using more than 1 SE). Three real data sets (for scorpions, spiders and lizards) comprising both discrete and quantitative characters are analyzed to study the performance of continuous characters. One of the matrices has a reduced number of continuous characters, and thus continuous characters analyzed by themselves produce only poorly resolved trees; the support for many of the groups supported by the discrete characters alone, however, is increased when the continuous characters are added to the analysis. The other two matrices have larger numbers of continuous characters, so that the results of separate analyses for the discrete and the continuous characters can be more meaningfully compared. In both cases, the continuous characters (analyzed alone) result in trees that are relatively similar to the trees produced by the discrete characters alone. These results suggest that continuous characters carry indeed phylogenetic information, and that (if they have been observed) there is no real reason to exclude them from the analysis.},

	abstract = {Gene tree topologies have proven a powerful data source for various tasks, including species tree inference and species delimitation. Consequently, methods for computing probabilities of gene trees within species trees have been developed and widely used in probabilistic inference frameworks. All these methods assume an underlying multispecies coalescent model. However, when reticulate evolutionary events such as hybridization occur, these methods are inadequate, as they do not account for such events. Methods that account for both hybridization and deep coalescence in computing the probability of a gene tree topology currently exist for very limited cases. However, no such methods exist for general cases, owing primarily to the fact that it is currently unknown how to compute the probability of a gene tree topology within the branches of a phylogenetic network. Here we present a novel method for computing the probability of gene tree topologies on phylogenetic networks and demonstrate its application to the inference of hybridization in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting. We reanalyze a Saccharomyces species data set for which multiple analyses had converged on a species tree candidate. Using our method, though, we show that an evolutionary hypothesis involving hybridization in this group has better support than one of strict divergence. A similar reanalysis on a group of three Drosophila species shows that the data is consistent with hybridization. Further, using extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate the power of gene tree topologies at obtaining accurate estimates of branch lengths and hybridization probabilities of a given phylogenetic network. Finally, we discuss identifiability issues with detecting hybridization, particularly in cases that involve extinction or incomplete sampling of taxa.},

	abstract = {It is becoming evident that B-cell responses to particular epitopes or in particular contexts can be highly convergent at the molecular level. That is, depending on the epitope targeted, persons of diverse genetic backgrounds and immunological histories can use highly similar, stereotyped B-cell receptors (BCRs) for a particular response. In some cases, multiple people with immunity to a particular epitope or with a type of B-cell neoplasia will elicit antibodies encoded by essentially identical immunoglobulin gene rearrangements. In other cases, particular VH genes encode antibodies important for immunity against pathogens such as influenza and HIV. It appears that the conserved antibody structures driving these stereotyped responses are highly limited and selected. There are interesting and important convergences in the types of stereotyped BCRs induced in conditions of immunity and B-cell-related pathology such as cancer and autoimmunity. By characterizing and understanding stereotyped B-cell responses, novel approaches to B-cell immunity and in understanding the underlying causes of B-cell pathology may be discovered. In this paper, we will review stereotyped BCR responses in various contexts of B-cell immunity and pathology.},

Most studies have focused on the classification of organisms based on structural comparison and local alignment of metabolic pathways. In contrast, global alignment of multiple metabolic networks complements sequence-based phylogenetic analyses and provides more comprehensive information.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: We explored the phylogenetic relationships between microorganisms through global alignment of multiple metabolic networks. The proposed approach integrates sequence homology data with topological information of metabolic networks. In general, compared to recent studies, the resulting trees reflect the living style of organisms as well as classical taxa. Moreover, for phylogenetically closely related organisms, the classification results are consistent with specific metabolic characteristics, such as the light-harvesting systems, fermentation types, and sources of electrons in photosynthesis.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the usefulness of global alignment of multiple metabolic networks to infer phylogenetic relationships between species. In addition, our exhaustive analysis of microbial metabolic pathways reveals differences in metabolic features between phylogenetically closely related organisms. With the ongoing increase in the number of genomic sequences and metabolic annotations, the proposed approach will help identify phenotypic variations that may not be apparent based solely on sequence-based classification.},

By calculating the probability of joint occupancy of two locations at a distance x, it is shown that a haploid model embodying the latter two assumptions violates the first, forming larger and larger clumps of individuals separated by greater and greater distances. Thus the model is biologically irrelevant, even though it is possible to use it to calculate probabilities of genetic identity at different distances. The formation of these clumps is verified by computer simulation. The same phenomenon occurs in two- and three-dimensional models. In models of finite regions (a circle or a torus), the formation of clumps takes the form of the certainty of ultimate local extinction of the organism in each region. This does not occur if we hold the number of individuals on the circle or torus constant, but considerable departure from random distribution still results.

Notably, bNAbs are highly somatically mutated and generated by a fraction of HIV-1-infected individuals several years after infection. Antibodies typically accumulate mutations in the complementarity determining region (CDR) loops, which usually contact the antigen. The CDR loops are scaffolded by canonical framework regions (FWRs) that are both resistant to and less tolerant of mutations. Here, we report that in contrast to most antibodies, including those with limited HIV-1 neutralizing activity, most bNAbs require somatic mutations in their FWRs. Structural and functional analyses reveal that somatic mutations in FWR residues enhance breadth and potency by providing increased flexibility and/or direct antigen contact. Thus, in bNAbs, FWRs play an essential role beyond scaffolding the CDR loops and their unusual contribution to potency and breadth should be considered in HIV-1 vaccine design. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Layered upon this are gene- and lineage-specific variation in amino acid substitution rates and compositional biases. Life trait variations that may impact upon mutational rates are longevity, metabolic rate, body size, and germ line generation time. Over the past 12 years, three main conflicting hypotheses have emerged for the placement of the placental root. These hypotheses place the Atlantogenata (common ancestor of Xenarthra plus Afrotheria), the Afrotheria, or the Xenarthra as the sister group to all other placental mammals. Model adequacy is critical for accurate tree reconstruction and by failing to account for these compositional and character exchange heterogeneities across the tree and data set, previous studies have not provided a strongly supported hypothesis for the placental root. For the first time, models that accommodate both tree and data set heterogeneity have been applied to mammal data. Here, we show the impact of accurate model assignment and the importance of data sets in accommodating model parameters while maintaining the power to reject competing hypotheses. Through these sophisticated methods, we demonstrate the importance of model adequacy, data set power and provide strong support for the Atlantogenata over other competing hypotheses for the position of the placental root.},

	abstract = {Theories of ecological diversification make predictions about the timing and ordering of character state changes through history. These theories are testable by 'reconstructing' ancestor states using phylogenetic trees and measurements of contemporary species. Here we use maximum likelihood to estimate and evaluate the accuracy of ancestor reconstructions. We present likelihoods of discrete ancestor states and derive probability distributions for continuous ancestral traits. The methods are applied to several examples: diets of ancestral Darwin's finches; origin of inquilinism in gall wasps; microhabitat partitioning and body size evolution in scrubwrens; digestive enzyme evolution in artiodactyl mammals; origin of a sexually selected male trait, the sword, in platies and swordtails; and evolution of specialization in Anolis lizards. When changes between discrete character states are rare, the maximumlikelihood results are similar to parsimony estimates. In this case the accuracy of estimates is often high, with the exception of some nodes deep in the tree. If change is frequent then reconstructions are highly uncertain, especially of distant ancestors. Ancestor states for continuous traits are typically highly uncertain. We conclude that measures of uncertainty are useful and should always be provided, despite simplistic assumptions about the probabilistic models that underlie them. If uncertainty is too high, reconstruction should be abandoned in favor of approaches that fit different models of trait evolution to species data and phylogenetic trees, taking into account the range of ancestor states permitted by the data.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic analysis is sometimes regarded as being an intimidating, complex process that requires expertise and years of experience. In fact, it is a fairly straightforward process that can be learned quickly and applied effectively. This Protocol describes the several steps required to produce a phylogenetic tree from molecular data for novices. In the example illustrated here, the program MEGA is used to implement all those steps, thereby eliminating the need to learn several programs, and to deal with multiple file formats from one step to another (Tamura K, Peterson D, Peterson N, Stecher G, Nei M, Kumar S. 2011. MEGA5: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis using maximum likelihood, evolutionary distance, and maximum parsimony methods. Mol Biol Evol. 28:2731-2739). The first step, identification of a set of homologous sequences and downloading those sequences, is implemented by MEGA's own browser built on top of the Google Chrome toolkit. For the second step, alignment of those sequences, MEGA offers two different algorithms: ClustalW and MUSCLE. For the third step, construction of a phylogenetic tree from the aligned sequences, MEGA offers many different methods. Here we illustrate the maximum likelihood method, beginning with MEGA's Models feature, which permits selecting the most suitable substitution model. Finally, MEGA provides a powerful and flexible interface for the final step, actually drawing the tree for publication. Here a step-by-step protocol is presented in sufficient detail to allow a novice to start with a sequence of interest and to build a publication-quality tree illustrating the evolution of an appropriate set of homologs of that sequence.

	abstract = {We revisit statistical tests for branches of evolutionary trees reconstructed upon molecular data. A new, fast, approximate likelihood-ratio test (aLRT) for branches is presented here as a competitive alternative to nonparametric bootstrap and Bayesian estimation of branch support. The aLRT is based on the idea of the conventional LRT, with the null hypothesis corresponding to the assumption that the inferred branch has length 0. We show that the LRT statistic is asymptotically distributed as a maximum of three random variables drawn from the  distribution. The new aLRT of interior branch uses this distribution for significance testing, but the test statistic is approximated in a slightly conservative but practical way as 2(ℓ1− ℓ2), i.e., double the difference between the maximum log-likelihood values corresponding to the best tree and the second best topological arrangement around the branch of interest. Such a test is fast because the log-likelihood value ℓ2 is computed by optimizing only over the branch of interest and the four adjacent branches, whereas other parameters are fixed at their optimal values corresponding to the best ML tree. The performance of the new test was studied on simulated 4-, 12-, and 100-taxon data sets with sequences of different lengths. The aLRT is shown to be accurate, powerful, and robust to certain violations of model assumptions. The aLRT is implemented within the algorithm used by the recent fast maximum likelihood tree estimation program PHYML (Guindon and Gascuel, 2003).},

The five most important variables explaining variation among estimates, in order of importance, were fluctuation in population size, variance in family size, form of N used (adults v. breeders v. total size), taxonomic group and unequal sex-ratio. There were no significant effects on the ratio of high v. low fecundity, demographic v. genetic methods of estimation, or of overlapping v. non-overlapping generations when the same variables were included in estimates.

Removal of soft part characters from 78 modern vertebrate and invertebrate morphological datasets resulted in significant changes to phylogenetic signal; it caused individual taxa to drift from their original position, predominately downward toward the root of their respective trees. This last bias could systematically inflate evolutionary rates inferred from molecular data because first fossil occurrences will not be recognised as such. Stem-ward slippage, whereby fundamental taphonomic biases cause fossils to be interpreted as erroneously primitive, is therefore a ubiquitous problem for all biologists attempting to infer macroevolutionary rates or sequences.},

Finally, we report simulations showing that the corrected distance outperforms many other k-mer methods, even when sequences are generated with an insertion and deletion process.

Beyond the relationship between amino acid substitution and static protein structure, protein function, and corresponding organismal fitness, other considerations are also discussed. More complex mutational processes such as insertion and deletion and domain rearrangements and even circular permutations should be evaluated. The role of intrinsically disordered proteins is still controversial, but may be increasingly important to consider. Protein geometry and protein dynamics as a deviation from static considerations of protein structure are also important. Protein expression level is known to be a major determinant of evolutionary rate and several considerations including selection at the mRNA level and the role of interaction specificity are discussed. Lastly, the relationship between modeling and needed high-throughput experimental data as well as experimental examination of protein evolution using ancestral sequence resurrection and in vitro biochemistry are presented, towards an aim of ultimately generating better models for biological inference and prediction.},

The ARB software suite with its corresponding rRNA datasets has been accepted by researchers worldwide as a standard tool for large scale rRNA analysis. However, the rapid increase of publicly available rRNA sequence data has recently hampered the maintenance of comprehensive and curated rRNA knowledge databases. A new system, SILVA (from Latin silva, forest), was implemented to provide a central comprehensive web resource for up to date, quality controlled databases of aligned rRNA sequences from the Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya domains. All sequences are checked for anomalies, carry a rich set of sequence associated contextual information, have multiple taxonomic classifications, and the latest validly described nomenclature. Furthermore, two precompiled sequence datasets compatible with ARB are offered for download on the SILVA website: (i) the reference (Ref) datasets, comprising only high quality, nearly full length sequences suitable for in-depth phylogenetic analysis and probe design and (ii) the comprehensive Parc datasets with all publicly available rRNA sequences longer than 300 nucleotides suitable for biodiversity analyses. The latest publicly available database release 91 (August 2007) hosts 547 521 sequences split into 461 823 small subunit and 85 689 large subunit rRNAs.},

This study examined new and existing specimens using molecular (mtDNA and nuDNA) techniques and morphological characters to revise the genus. Both approaches support placing H. magnipinna and H. martensi as junior synonyms of H. robustipinna. Sequence data for specimens attributed to H. bartschi also place this species as a junior synonym of H. robustipinna, despite some morphological disparity. Himerometra sol is retained as distinct despite morphological congruence with H. robustipinna, because the two known specimens were collected outside the known range of the latter, with no molecular data currently available. Himerometra persica is herein transferred to Heterometra: the type specimens were incorrectly identified. The species treated as valid are redescribed. This study illustrates the importance of re-examining crinoid species boundaries for established taxa without molecular corroboration and demonstrates that diversity in this particular feather star clade might be lower than previously thought.},

	abstract = {Viral phylogenetic methods contribute to understanding how HIV spreads in populations, and thereby help guide the design of prevention interventions. So far, most analyses have been applied to well-sampled concentrated HIV-1 epidemics in wealthy countries. To direct the use of phylogenetic tools to where the impact of HIV-1 is greatest, the Phylogenetics And Networks for Generalized HIV Epidemics in Africa (PANGEA-HIV) consortium generates full-genome viral sequences from across sub-Saharan Africa. Analyzing these data presents new challenges, since epidemics are principally driven by heterosexual transmission and a smaller fraction of cases is sampled. Here, we show that viral phylogenetic tools can be adapted and used to estimate epidemiological quantities of central importance to HIV-1 prevention in sub-Saharan Africa. We used a community-wide methods comparison exercise on simulated data, where participants were blinded to the true dynamics they were inferring. Two distinct simulations captured generalized HIV-1 epidemics, before and after a large community-level intervention that reduced infection levels. Five research groups participated. Structured coalescent modelling approaches were most successful: phylogenetic estimates of HIV-1 incidence, incidence reductions, and the proportion of transmissions from individuals in their first three months of infection correlated with the true values (Pearson correlation {\textgreater} 90\%), with small bias. However, on some simulations, true values were markedly outside reported confidence or credibility intervals. The blinded comparison revealed current limits and strengths in using HIV phylogenetics in challenging settings, provided benchmarks for future methods’ development, and supports using the latest generation of phylogenetic tools to advance HIV surveillance and prevention.},

	abstract = {Methods that use outgroups in the reconstruction of phylogeny are described and evaluated by the criterion of parsimony. By considering the character states and relationships of outgroups, one can estimate the states ancestral for a study group or ingroup, even when several character states are found among the outgroups. Algorithms and rules are presented that find the most parsimonious estimates of ancestral states for binary and multistate characters when outgroup relationships are well resolved. Other rules indicate the extent to which uncertainty about outgroup relationships leads to uncertainty about the ancestral states. The algorithms and rules are based on "simple parsimony" in that convergences and reversals are counted equally. After parsimony is measured locally among the outgroups to estimate ancestral states, parsimony is measured locally within the ingroup, given the ancestral states, to find the ingroup cladogram. This two-step procedure is shown to find the ingroup cladograms that are most parsimonious globally; that is, most parsimonious when parsimony is measured simultaneously over the ingroup and outgroups. However, the two-step procedure is guaranteed to achieve global parsimony only when: (a) outgroup relationships are sufficiently resolved beforehand; (b) outgroup analysis is taken to indicate the state not in the most recent common ancestor of the ingroup, but in a more distant ancestor; and (c) ancestral states are considered while the ingroup is being resolved, not merely added afterward to root an unrooted network. The criterion of global parsimony is then applied to evaluate procedures used when outgroup relationships are poorly resolved. The procedure that chooses as ancestral the state occurring most commonly among the outgroups can sometimes yield cladograms that are not globally parsimonious. By the criterion of global parsimony, the best procedure is one that simultaneously resolves the outgroups and ingroup with the data at hand. Finally, simple parsimony can choose among competing hypotheses, but it often fails to indicate how much confidence can be placed in that choice.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Constructing species trees from multi-copy gene trees remains a challenging problem in phylogenetics. One difficulty is that the underlying genes can be incongruent due to evolutionary processes such as gene duplication and loss, deep coalescence, or lateral gene transfer. Gene tree estimation errors may further exacerbate the difficulties of species tree estimation.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: We present a new approach for inferring species trees from incongruent multi-copy gene trees that is based on a generalization of the Robinson-Foulds (RF) distance measure to multi-labeled trees (mul-trees). We prove that it is NP-hard to compute the RF distance between two mul-trees; however, it is easy to calculate this distance between a mul-tree and a singly-labeled species tree. Motivated by this, we formulate the RF problem for mul-trees (MulRF) as follows: Given a collection of multi-copy gene trees, find a singly-labeled species tree that minimizes the total RF distance from the input mul-trees. We develop and implement a fast SPR-based heuristic algorithm for the NP-hard MulRF problem.We compare the performance of the MulRF method (available at http://genome.cs.iastate.edu/CBL/MulRF/) with several gene tree parsimony approaches using gene tree simulations that incorporate gene tree error, gene duplications and losses, and/or lateral transfer. The MulRF method produces more accurate species trees than gene tree parsimony approaches. We also demonstrate that the MulRF method infers in minutes a credible plant species tree from a collection of nearly 2,000 gene trees.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Our new phylogenetic inference method, based on a generalized RF distance, makes it possible to quickly estimate species trees from large genomic data sets. Since the MulRF method, unlike gene tree parsimony, is based on a generic tree distance measure, it is appealing for analyses of genomic data sets, in which many processes such as deep coalescence, recombination, gene duplication and losses as well as phylogenetic error may contribute to gene tree discord. In experiments, the MulRF method estimated species trees accurately and quickly, demonstrating MulRF as an efficient alternative approach for phylogenetic inference from large-scale genomic data sets.},

	abstract = {For more than thirty years, the parallel programming community has used the dependence graph as the main abstraction for reason- ing about and exploiting parallelism in regular algorithms that use dense arrays, such as ﬁnite-differences and FFTs. In this paper, we argue that the dependence graph is not a suitable abstraction for algorithms in new application areas like machine learning and net- work analysis in which the key data structures are irregular data structures like graphs, trees, and sets. To address the need for better abstractions, we introduce a data- centric formulation of algorithms called the operator formulation in which an algorithm is expressed in terms of its action on data structures. This formulation is the basis for a structural analysis of algorithms that we call tao-analysis. Tao-analysis can be viewed as an abstraction of algorithms that distills out algorithmic proper- ties important for parallelization. It reveals that a generalized form of data-parallelism called amorphous data-parallelism is ubiqui- tous in algorithms, and that, depending on the tao-structure of the algorithm, this parallelism may be exploited by compile-time, inspector-executor or optimistic parallelization, thereby unifying these seemingly unrelated parallelization techniques. Regular algo- rithms emerge as a special case of irregular algorithms, and many application-speciﬁc optimization techniques can be generalized to a broader context. These results suggest that the operator formulation and tao- analysis of algorithms can be the foundation of a systematic ap- proach to parallel programming.},

As this is not the case, various strategies have been proposed to combine paleontological and neontological data sets. The use of fossil dates as node age calibrations for divergence time estimation from molecular phylogenies is commonplace. In addition, simulations suggest that the addition of morphological data from extinct taxa may improve phylogenetic estimation when combined with molecular data for extant species, and some studies have merged morphological and molecular data to estimate combined evidence phylogenies containing both extinct and extant taxa. However, few, if any, studies have attempted to estimate divergence times using phylogenies containing both fossil and living taxa sampled for both molecular and morphological data. Here, I infer both the phylogeny and the time of origin for Lissamphibia and a number of stem tetrapods using Bayesian methods based on a data set containing morphological data for extinct taxa, molecular data for extant taxa, and molecular and morphological data for a subset of extant taxa. The results suggest that Lissamphibia is monophyletic, nested within Lepospondyli, and originated in the late Carboniferous at the earliest. This research illustrates potential pitfalls for the use of fossils as post hoc age constraints on internal nodes and highlights the importance of explicit phylogenetic analysis of extinct taxa. These results suggest that the application of fossils as minima or maxima on molecular phylogenies should be supplemented or supplanted by combined evidence analyses whenever possible.},

Comparative studies among the more than 100 species of Rana rely on an understanding of the evolutionary history and patterns of diversification of the group. We estimate a well-resolved, time-calibrated phylogeny from sequences of six nuclear and three mitochondrial loci sampled from most species of Rana, and use that phylogeny to clarify the group’s diversification and global biogeography. Our analyses consistently support an “Out of Asia” pattern with two independent dispersals of Rana from East Asia to North America via Beringian land bridges. The more species-rich lineage of New World Rana appears to have experienced a rapid radiation following its colonization of the New World, especially with its expansion into montane and tropical areas of Mexico, Central America, and South America. In contrast, Old World Rana exhibit different trajectories of diversification; diversification in the Old World began very slowly and later underwent a distinct increase in speciation rate around 29–18 Ma. Net diversification is associated with environmental changes and especially intensive tectonic movements along the Asian margin from the Oligocene to early Miocene. Our phylogeny further suggests that previous classifications were misled by morphological homoplasy and plesiomorphic color patterns, as well as a reliance primarily on mitochondrial genes. We provide a phylogenetic taxonomy based on analyses of multiple nuclear and mitochondrial gene loci. [Amphibians; biogeography; diversification rate; Holarctic; transcontinental dispersal.},

By experimentally intervening at a community level to modify risk behavior norms, it may be possible to promote generalized reductions in HIV risk practices within a population. METHODS: We trained persons reliably identified as popular opinion leaders among gay men in a small city to serve as behavior change endorsers to their peers. The opinion leaders acquired social skills for making these endorsements and complied in talking frequently with friends and acquaintances. Before and after intervention, we conducted surveys of men patronizing gay clubs in the intervention city and in two matched comparison cities. RESULTS: In the intervention city, the proportion of men who engaged in any unprotected anal intercourse in a two-month period decreased from 36.9 percent to 27.5 percent (-25 percent from baseline), with a reduction from 27.1 percent to 19.0 percent (-30 percent from baseline) for unprotected receptive anal intercourse. Relative to baseline levels, there was a 16 percent increase in condom use during anal intercourse and an 18 percent decrease in the proportion of men with more than one sexual partner. Little or no change was observed among men in the comparison cities over the same period of time. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that employ peer leaders to endorse change may produce or accelerate population behavior changes to lessen risk for HIV infection.},

	abstract = {The paper describes a mutational equilibrium model of genome size evolution. This model is different from both adaptive and junk DNA models of genome size evolution in that it does not assume that genome size is maintained either by positive or stabilizing selection for the optimum genome size (as in adaptive theories) or by purifying selection against too much junk DNA (as in junk DNA theories). Instead the genome size is suggested to evolve until the loss of DNA through more frequent small deletions is equal to the rate of DNA gain through more frequent long insertions. The empirical basis for this theory is the finding of a strong correlation and of a clear power-function relationship between the rate of mutational DNA loss (per bp) through small deletions and genome size in animals. Genome size scales as a negative 1.3 power function of the deletion rate per nucleotide. Such a relationship is not predicted by either adaptive or junk DNA theories. However, if genome size is maintained at equilibrium by the balance of mutational forces, this empirilical relationship can be readily accommodated. Within this framework, this finding would imply that the rate of DNA gain through large insertions scales up a quarter-power function of genome size. On this view, as genome size grows, the rate of growth through large insertions is increasing as a quarter power function of genome size and the rate of DNA loss through small deletions increases linearly, until eventually, at the stable equilibrium genome size value, rates of growth and loss equal each other. The current data also suggest that the long-term variation is genome size in animals is brought about to a significant extent by changes in the intrinsic rates of DNA loss through small deletions. Both the origin of mutational biases and the adaptive consequences of such a mode of evolution of genome size are discussed.},

Phylogenetic trees inferred using commonly-used models of sequence evolution are unrooted, but the root position matters both for interpretation and downstream applications. This issue has been long recognized; however, whether the potential for discordance between the species tree and gene trees impacts methods of rooting a phylogenetic tree has not been extensively studied. In this paper, we introduce a new method of rooting a tree based on its branch length distribution; our method, which minimizes the variance of root to tip distances, is inspired by the traditional midpoint rerooting and is justified when deviations from the strict molecular clock are random. Like midpoint rerooting, the method can be implemented in a linear time algorithm. In extensive simulations that consider discordance between gene trees and the species tree, we show that the new method is more accurate than midpoint rerooting, but its relative accuracy compared to using outgroups to root gene trees depends on the size of the dataset and levels of deviations from the strict clock. We show high levels of error for all methods of rooting estimated gene trees due to factors that include effects of gene tree discordance, deviations from the clock, and gene tree estimation error. Our simulations, however, did not reveal significant differences between two equivalent methods for species tree estimation that use rooted and unrooted input, namely, STAR and NJst. Nevertheless, our results point to limitations of existing scalable rooting methods.},

Here, we introduce a new method that quantifies host population structure based on phylogenetic trees, which are obtained from pathogen genetic sequence data. Our method is based on a maximum-likelihood framework and uses a multi-type branching process, under which each host is assigned to a type (subpopulation). In a simulation study, we show that our method produces accurate parameter estimates for phylogenetic trees in which each tip is assigned to a type, as well for phylogenetic trees in which the type of the tip is unknown. We apply the method to a Latvian HIV-1 dataset, quantifying the impact of the intravenous drug user epidemic on the heterosexual epidemic (known tip states), and identifying superspreader dynamics within the men-having-sex-with-men epidemic (unknown tip states).},

(tunicates and cephalochordates) and three other invertebrate taxa:
hemichordates, echinoderms and Xenoturbella. The relationships between
invertebrate and vertebrate deuterostomes are clearly important for
understanding our own distant origins. Recent phylogenetic studies
of chordate classes and a sea urchin have indicated that urochordates
might be the closest invertebrate sister group of vertebrates, rather
than cephalochordates, as traditionally believed. More remarkable
is the suggestion that cephalochordates are closer to echinoderms
than to vertebrates and urochordates, meaning that chordates are
paraphyletic. To study the relationships among all deuterostome groups,
we have assembled an alignment of more than 35,000 homologous amino
acids, including new data from a hemichordate, starfish and Xenoturbella.
We have also sequenced the mitochondrial genome of Xenoturbella.
We support the clades Olfactores (urochordates and vertebrates) and
Ambulacraria (hemichordates and echinoderms). Analyses using our
new data, however, do not support a cephalochordate and echinoderm
grouping and we conclude that chordates are monophyletic. Finally,
nuclear and mitochondrial data place Xenoturbella as the sister group
of the two ambulacrarian phyla. As such, Xenoturbella is shown to
be an independent phylum, Xenoturbellida, bringing the number of
living deuterostome phyla to four.},

In a 1997 paper, Maddison discussed this relation, reviewed the signatures left by three major evolutionary processes on the gene trees, and surveyed parsimony and likelihood criteria for utilizing these signatures to elucidate computationally this relation.

Very little is known about the accuracy with which such alignment-free methods recover the correct phylogeny or about the potential for increasing their accuracy. We conducted a large-scale comparison of ten alignment-free methods, among them one new approach that does not calculate distances and a faster variant of our pattern-based approach; all distance-based alignment-free methods are freely available from http://www.bioinformatics.org.au (as Python package decaf+py). We show that most methods exhibit a higher overall reconstruction accuracy in the presence of high among-site rate variation. Under all conditions that we considered, variants of the pattern-based approach were significantly better than the other alignment-free methods. The new pattern-based variant achieved a speed-up of an order of magnitude in the distance calculation step, accompanied by a small loss of tree reconstruction accuracy. A method of Bayesian inference from k-mers did not improve on classical alignment-free (and distance-based) methods but may still offer other advantages due to its Bayesian nature. We found the optimal word length k of word-based methods to be stable across various data sets, and we provide parameter ranges for two different alphabets. The influence of these alphabets was analyzed to reveal a trade-off in reconstruction accuracy between long and short branches. We have mapped the phylogenetic accuracy for many alignment-free methods, among them several recently introduced ones, and increased our understanding of their behavior in response to biologically important parameters. In all experiments, the pattern-based approach emerged as superior, at the expense of higher resource consumption. Nonetheless, no alignment-free method that we examined recovers the correct phylogeny as accurately as does an approach based on maximum-likelihood distance estimates of multiply aligned sequences.},

Eliciting these antibodies via vaccination appears to be remarkably difficult, not least because they arise late in infection and are highly mutated relative to germline antibody sequences. Here, using a computational model, we show that broad antibodies could in fact emerge earlier and be less mutated, but that they may be prevented from doing so as a result of competitive exclusion by the autologous antibody response. We further find that this competitive exclusion is weaker in infections founded by multiple distinct strains, with broadly neutralizing antibodies emerging earlier than in infections founded by a single strain. Our computational model simulates coevolving multitype virus and antibody populations. Broadly neutralizing antibodies may therefore be easier for the adaptive immune system to generate than previously thought. If less mutated broad antibodies exist, it may be possible to elicit them with a vaccine containing a mixture of diverse virus strains.},

Single-tree consensus as postprocessing methods can be unsatisfactory due to their inherent limitations.  Results: In this paper we present an alternative approach by using clustering algorithms on the set of candidate trees. We propose bicriterion problems, in particular using the concept of information loss, and new consensus trees called characteristic trees that minimize the information loss. Our empirical study using four biological datasets shows that our approach provides a significant improvement in the information content, while adding only a small amount of complexity. Furthermore, the consensus trees we obtain for each of our large clusters are more resolved than the single-tree consensus trees. We also provide some initial progress on theoretical questions that arise in this context.  Availability: Software available upon request from the authors. The agglomerative clustering is implemented using Matlab (MathWorks, 2000) with the Statistics Toolbox.

The charge output is amplified and read using NOVA RENA-3 ASICs. This paper shows that the coincidence timing resolution of the RENA-3 ASIC can be improved using certain list-mode calibrations. We treat the calibration problem as a convex optimization problem and use the RENA-3s analog-based timing system to correct the measured data for time dispersion effects from correlated noise, PSAPD signal delays and varying signal amplitudes. The direct solution to the optimization problem involves a matrix inversion that grows order (n3) with the number of parameters. An iterative method using single-coordinate descent to approximate the inversion grows order (n). The inversion does not need to run to convergence, since any gains at high iteration number will be low compared to noise amplification. The system calibration method is demonstrated with measured pulser data as well as with two LSO-PSAPD detectors in electronic coincidence. After applying the algorithm, the 511keV photopeak paired coincidence time resolution from the LSO-PSAPD detectors under study improved by 57\%, from the raw value of 16.30.07 ns FWHM to 6.920.02 ns FWHM (11.520.05 ns to 4.890.02 ns for unpaired photons).},

	abstract = {This is the first book on "phylogenetic supertrees", a recent, but controversial development for inferring evolutionary trees. Rather than analyze the combined primary character data directly, supertree construction proceeds by combining the tree topologies derived from those data. This difference in strategy has allowed for the exciting possibility of larger, more complete phylogenies than are otherwise currently possible, with the potential to revolutionize evolutionarily-based research. This book provides a comprehensive look at supertrees, ranging from the methods used to build supertrees to the significance of supertrees to bioinformatic and biological research. Reviews of many the major supertree methods are provided and four new techniques, including a Bayesian implementation of supertrees, are described for the first time. The far-reaching impact of supertrees on biological research is highlighted both in general terms and through specific examples from diverse clades such as flowering plants, even-toed ungulates, and primates. The book also critically examines the many outstanding challenges and problem areas for this relatively new field, showing the way for supertree construction in the age of genomics. Interdisciplinary contributions from the majority of the leading authorities on supertree construction in all areas of the bioinformatic community (biology, computer sciences, and mathematics) will ensure that this book is a valuable reference with wide appeal to anyone interested in phylogenetic inference.},

Nine of these individuals were enrolled during acute infection; all were men who have sex with men (MSM) infected with HIV-1 subtype B. A total of 475 nearly full-length HIV-1 genome sequences were generated, representing on average 10 genomes per specimen at 2 to 12 visits over the first year of infection. Single founding variants with nearly homogeneous viral populations were detected in eight of the nine individuals who were enrolled during acute HIV-1 infection. Restriction to a single founder variant was not due to a lack of diversity in the transmitter as homogeneous populations were found in recipients from transmitters with chronic infection. Mutational patterns indicative of rapid viral population growth dominated during the first 5 weeks of infection and included a slight contraction of viral genetic diversity over the first 20 to 40 days. Subsequently, selection dominated, most markedly in env and nef. Mutants were detected in the first week and became consensus as early as day 21 after the onset of symptoms of primary HIV infection. We found multiple indications of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) escape mutations while reversions appeared limited. Putative escape mutations were often rapidly replaced with mutually exclusive mutations nearby, indicating the existence of a maturational escape process, possibly in adaptation to viral fitness constraints or to immune responses against new variants. We showed that establishment of HIV-1 infection is likely due to a biological mechanism that restricts transmission rather than to early adaptive evolution during acute infection. Furthermore, the diversity of HIV strains coupled with complex and individual-specific patterns of CTL escape did not reveal shared sequence characteristics of acute infection that could be harnessed for vaccine design.},

These phylogenetically aware correlation methods{\textbackslash}nhave been applied with enthusiasm, although there have{\textbackslash}nbeen skeptics questioning their need (Westoby 1999) and{\textbackslash}ncautions expressed over their use (Ricklefs and Starck{\textbackslash}n1996; Freckleton 2009).{\textbackslash}nNot all is healthy with the paradigm, however.{\textbackslash}nFor categorical characters a special concern has been{\textbackslash}nraised: commonly used and well-respected methods{\textbackslash}n(e.g., Pagel 1994), do not eliminate pseudoreplication,{\textbackslash}nas they are susceptible to an effect from a single{\textbackslash}nevolutionary event (Maddison 1990, 2000; Read and Nee{\textbackslash}n1995; Ridley and Grafen 1996; Grafen and Ridley 1997).{\textbackslash}nAs a result, a significant statistical association between{\textbackslash}ntraits inferred by these methods can mean very little{\textbackslash}nin some circumstances, misleading biologists about the{\textbackslash}nrelationship between traits.{\textbackslash}nAlthough this concern has been raised, there has been{\textbackslash}nlittle effect on the practice of comparative studies, we{\textbackslash}nthink because the issue has not been well understood.{\textbackslash}nWe do not, alas, have a solution.

	abstract = {Motivation: Traditionally, gene phylogenies have been reconstructed solely on the basis of mo- lecular sequences; this, however, often does not provide enough information to distinguish be- tween statistically equivalent relationships. To address this problem, several recent methods have incorporated information on the species phylogeny in gene tree reconstruction, leading to dramatic improvements in accuracy. Although probabilistic methods are able to estimate all model param- eters but are computationally expensive, parsimony methods—generally computationally more ef- ficient—require a prior estimate of parameters and of the statistical support. Results: Here, we present the Tree Estimation using Reconciliation (TERA) algorithm, a parsimony based, species tree aware method for gene tree reconstruction based on a scoring scheme combin- ing duplication, transfer and loss costs with an estimate of the sequence likelihood. TERA explores all reconciled gene trees that can be amalgamated from a sample of gene trees. Using a large scale simulated dataset, we demonstrate that TERA achieves the same accuracy as the corresponding probabilistic method while being faster, and outperforms other parsimony-based methods in both accuracy and speed. Running TERA on a set of 1099 homologous gene families from complete cyanobacterial genomes, we find that incorporating knowledge of the species tree results in a two thirds reduction in the number of apparent transfer events. Availability and implementation: The algorithm is implemented in our program TERA, which is freely available from http://mbb.univ-montp2.fr/MBB/download\_sources/16\_\_TERA.},

Incongruence severity increased for shorter internodes located deeper in the phylogeny. Notably, whereas most practices had little or negative impact on the yeast phylogeny, the use of genes or internodes with high average internode support significantly improved the robustness of inference. We obtained similar results in analyses of vertebrate and metazoan phylogenomic data sets. These results question the exclusive reliance on concatenation and associated practices, and argue that selecting genes with strong phylogenetic signals and demonstrating the absence of significant incongruence are essential for accurately reconstructing ancient divergences.},

A classical local search problem is the \{{\textbackslash}tt NNI\} search problem, which is based on the nearest neighbor interchange operation. In this work, we 1) provide a novel near-linear time algorithm for the \{{\textbackslash}tt NNI\} search problem, 2) introduce extensions that significantly enlarge the search space of the \{{\textbackslash}tt NNI\} search problem, and 3) present algorithms for these extended versions that are asymptotically just as efficient as our algorithm for the \{{\textbackslash}tt NNI\} search problem. The exceptional speedup achieved in the extended \{{\textbackslash}tt NNI\} search problems makes the gene-duplication problem more tractable for large-scale phylogenetic analyses.

There is a need to evaluate the new methods for species tree reconstruction in order to determine what kinds of loci to use and the most effective sampling schemes in terms of numbers of genes and numbers of individuals per species. Here we study sampling strategies with an empirical data set for six shorebird species in which we sequenced 1 mitochondrial, 12 autosomal, and 12 Z-linked loci for {\textgreater}8 individuals/species. We found that sampling greater numbers of genes resulted in substantial improvements to the resolution of the species tree, but sampling greater numbers of individuals had minor effects. We found that Z-linked loci significantly outperformed autosomal loci at all levels of sampling, which likely resulted from the lower effective population size of the Z-linked loci. Therefore, sex-linked loci are likely to be a powerful tool for multi-locus phylogenetic studies. We found that adding a mitochondrial gene to a set of Z-linked or autosomal loci substantially improved the resolution of the tree. Overall, our results help evaluate how best to maximize phylogenetic resolution while minimizing the costs of sequencing and computation when performing species tree analyses. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

The next matching symbol is chosen from each state, recording its probability (frequency) and also the probability of going to that state from a previous one (the transition probability). State and transition probabilities are multiplied to obtain a probability of the given sequence. The hidden nature of the HMM is due to the lack of information about the value of a specific state, which is instead represented by a probability distribution over all possible values.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In addition to component-based comparative approaches, network alignments provide the means to study conserved network topology such as common pathways and more complex network motifs. Yet, unlike in classical sequence alignment, the comparison of networks becomes computationally more challenging, as most meaningful assumptions instantly lead to NP-hard problems. Most previous algorithmic work on network alignments is heuristic in nature. RESULTS: We introduce the graph-based maximum structural matching formulation for pairwise global network alignment. We relate the formulation to previous work and prove NP-hardness of the problem. Based on the new formulation we build upon recent results in computational structural biology and present a novel Lagrangian relaxation approach that, in combination with a branch-and-bound method, computes provably optimal network alignments. The Lagrangian algorithm alone is a powerful heuristic method, which produces solutions that are often near-optimal and - unlike those computed by pure heuristics - come with a quality guarantee. CONCLUSION: Computational experiments on the alignment of protein-protein interaction networks and on the classification of metabolic subnetworks demonstrate that the new method is reasonably fast and has advantages over pure heuristics.

	abstract = {Because of the increase of genomic data, multiple genes are often available for the inference of phylogenetic relationships. The simple approach for combining multiple genes from the same taxon is to concatenate the sequences and then ignore the fact that different positions in the concatenated sequence came from different genes. Here, we discuss two criteria for inferring the optimal tree topology from data sets with multiple genes. These criteria are designed for multigene data sets where gene-specific evolutionary features are too important to ignore. One criterion is conventional and is obtained by taking the sum of log-likelihoods over all genes. The other criterion is obtained by dividing the log-likelihood for a gene by its sequence length and then taking the arithmetic mean over genes of these ratios. A similar strategy could be adopted with parsimony scores. The optimal tree is then declared to be the one for which the sum or the arithmetic mean is maximized. These criteria are justified within a two-stage hierarchical framework. The first level of the hierarchy represents gene-specific evolutionary features, and the second represents site-specific features for given genes. For testing significance of the optimal topology, we suggest a two-stage bootstrap procedure that involves resampling genes and then resampling alignment columns within resampled genes. An advantage of this procedure over concatenation is that it can effectively account for gene-specific evolutionary features. We discuss the applicability of the two-stage bootstrap idea to the Kishino-Hasegawa test and the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test.},

By far the most commonly used is the Kishino-Hasegawa test. However, the assumptions that have to be made to ensure the validity of the Kishino-Hasegawa test place important restrictions on its applicability. In particular, it is only valid when the topologies being compared are specified a priori. Unfortunately, this means that the Kishino-Hasegawa test may be severely biased in many cases in which it is now commonly used: for example, in any case in which one of the competing topologies has been selected for testing because it is the maximum likelihood topology for the data set at hand. We review the theory of the Kishino-Hasegawa test and contend that for the majority of popular applications this test should not be used. Previously published results from invalid applications of the Kishino-Hasegawa test should be treated extremely cautiously, and future applications should use appropriate alternative tests instead. We review such alternative tests, both nonparametric and parametric, and give two examples which illustrate the importance of our contentions.},

Comparative genomics, evolutionary biology, and cancer research all require tools to elucidate the mechanisms, history, and consequences of those evolutionary events, while phylogenetics could use whole-genome data to enhance its picture of the Tree of Life. Current approaches in the area of phylogenetic analysis are limited to very small collections of closely related genomes using low-resolution data (typically a few hundred syntenic blocks); moreover, these approaches typically do not include duplication and loss events. We describe a maximum likelihood (ML) approach for phylogenetic analysis that takes into account genome rearrangements as well as duplications, insertions, and losses. Our approach can handle high-resolution genomes (with 40,000 or more markers) and can use in the same analysis genomes with very different numbers of markers. Because our approach uses a standard ML reconstruction program (RAxML), it scales up to large trees. We present the results of extensive testing on both simulated and real data showing that our approach returns very accurate results very quickly. In particular, we analyze a dataset of 68 high-resolution eukaryotic genomes, with from 3,000 to 42,000 genes, from the eGOB database; the analysis, including bootstrapping, takes just 3 hours on a desktop system and returns a tree in agreement with all well supported branches, while also suggesting resolutions for some disputed placements.},

Test case prioritization techniques improve the cost-effectiveness of regression testing by ordering test cases such that those that are more important are run earlier in the testing process. Many prioritization techniques have been proposed and evidence shows that they can be beneficial. It has been suggested, however, that the time constraints that can be imposed on regression testing by various software development processes can strongly affect the behavior of prioritization techniques. Therefore, we conducted an experiment to assess the effects of time constraints on the costs and benefits of prioritization techniques. Our results show that time constraints can indeed play a significant role in determining both the cost-effectiveness of prioritization, and the relative cost-benefit tradeoffs among techniques, with important implications for the use of prioritization in practice. © 2008 ACM.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

	abstract = {Networks and the epidemiology of directly transmitted infectious diseases are fundamentally linked. The foundations of epidemiology and early epidemiological models were based on population wide random-mixing, but in practice each individual has a finite set of contacts to whom they can pass infection; the ensemble of all such contacts forms a 'mixing network'. Knowledge of the structure of the network allows models to compute the epidemic dynamics at the population scale from the individual-level behaviour of infections. Therefore, characteristics of mixing networks-and how these deviate from the random-mixing norm-have become important applied concerns that may enhance the understanding and prediction of epidemic patterns and intervention measures. Here, we review the basis of epidemiological theory (based on random-mixing models) and network theory (based on work from the social sciences and graph theory). We then describe a variety of methods that allow the mixing network, or an approximation to the network, to be ascertained. It is often the case that time and resources limit our ability to accurately find all connections within a network, and hence a generic understanding of the relationship between network structure and disease dynamics is needed. Therefore, we review some of the variety of idealized network types and approximation techniques that have been utilized to elucidate this link. Finally, we look to the future to suggest how the two fields of network theory and epidemiological modelling can deliver an improved understanding of disease dynamics and better public health through effective disease control.},

To identify selection, researchers often estimate the ratio of these relative rates (dN/dS) at individual alignment sites. Fitting a codon substitution model that captures heterogeneity in dN/dS across sites provides a reliable way to perform such estimation, but it remains computationally prohibitive for massive datasets. By using crude estimates of the numbers of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions at each site, counting approaches scale well to large datasets, but they fail to account for ancestral state reconstruction uncertainty and to provide site-specific dN/dS estimates.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: We propose a hybrid solution that borrows the computational strength of counting methods, but augments these methods with empirical Bayes modeling to produce a relatively fast and reliable method capable of estimating site-specific dN/dS values in large datasets. Importantly, our hybrid approach, set in a Bayesian framework, integrates over the posterior distribution of phylogenies and ancestral reconstructions to quantify uncertainty about site-specific dN/dS estimates. Simulations demonstrate that this method competes well with more-principled statistical procedures and, in some cases, even outperforms them. We illustrate the utility of our method using human immunodeficiency virus, feline panleukopenia and canine parvovirus evolution examples.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic inference can potentially result in a more accurate tree using data from multiple loci. However, if the loci are incongruent--due to events such as incomplete lineage sorting or horizontal gene transfer--it can be misleading to infer a single tree. To address this, many previous contributions have taken a mechanistic approach, by modelling specific processes. Alternatively, one can cluster loci without assuming how these incongruencies might arise. Such "process-agnostic" approaches typically infer a tree for each locus and cluster these. There are, however, many possible combinations of tree distance and clustering methods; their comparative performance in the context of tree incongruence is largely unknown. Furthermore, because standard model selection criteria such as AIC cannot be applied to problems with a variable number of topologies, the issue of inferring the optimal number of clusters is poorly understood. Here, we perform a large-scale simulation study of phylogenetic distances and clustering methods to infer loci of common evolutionary history. We observe that the best-performing combinations are distances accounting for branch lengths followed by spectral clustering or Wards method. We also introduce two statistical tests to infer the optimal number of clusters and show that they strongly outperform the silhouette criterion, a general-purpose heuristic. We illustrate the usefulness of the approach by (i) identifying errors in a previous phylogenetic analysis of yeast species and (ii) identifying topological incongruence among newly sequenced loci of the globeflower fly genus Chiastocheta. We release treeCl, a new program to cluster genes of common evolutionary history (http://git.io/treeCl).},

Although many methods are provably statistically consistent (i.e. the probability of recovering the correct tree converges to 1 as the sequence length increases), the actual rate of convergence for different methods has not been well understood. In a recent paper we introduced a new method for reconstructing evolutionary trees called the dyadic closure method (DCM), and we showed that DCM has a very fast convergence rate. DCM runs in O(n5 log n) time, where n is the number of sequences, and so, although polynomial, the computational requirements are potentially too large to be of use in practice. In this paper we present another tree reconstruction method, the witness-antiwitness method (WAM). WAM is faster than DCM, especially on random trees, and converges to the true tree topology at the same rate as DCM. We also compare WAM to other methods used to reconstruct trees, including Neighbor Joining (possibly the most popular method among molecular biologists), and new methods introduced in the computer science literature.},

As in CAT, the model implements a mixture of distinct Markovian processes of substitution distributed among sites, thus accommodating site-specific selective constraints induced by protein structure and function. Furthermore, as in BP, these processes are nonstationary, and their equilibrium frequencies are allowed to change along lineages in a correlated way, through discrete shifts in global amino acid composition distributed along the phylogenetic tree. We implemented the CAT-BP model in a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework and compared its predictions with those of 3 simpler models, BP, CAT, and the site- and time-homogeneous general time-reversible (GTR) model, on a concatenation of 4 mitochondrial proteins of 20 arthropod species. In contrast to GTR, BP, and CAT, which all display a phylogenetic reconstruction artifact positioning the bees Apis mellifera and Melipona bicolor among chelicerates, the CAT-BP model is able to recover the monophyly of insects. Using posterior predictive tests, we further show that the CAT-BP combination yields better anticipations of site- and taxon-specific amino acid frequencies and that it better accounts for the homoplasies that are responsible for the artifact. Altogether, our results show that the joint modeling of heterogeneities across sites and along time results in a synergistic improvement of the phylogenetic inference, indicating that it is essential to disentangle the combined effects of both sources of heterogeneity, in order to overcome systematic errors in protein phylogenetic analyses.},

	abstract = {Erroneous estimates of ingroup relationships can be caused by attributes in the outgroup chosen to root the tree. Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences frequently yield incorrect estimates of ingroup relationships when the outgroup used to “root” the tree is highly divergent from the ingroup. This is especially the case when the outgroup has a different base composition than the ingroup. Unfortunately, in many instances, alternative less divergent outgroups are not available. In such cases, investigators must either target genes with attributes that minimize the problem (slowly evolving genes with stationary base compositions – which are often not ideal for estimating relationships among the more closely related ingroup taxa) or use inference models that are explicitly tailored to deal with an attenuated historical signal with a superimposed non-stationary base composition. In this paper we explore the problem both empirically and through simulation. For the empirical component we looked at the phylogenetic relationships among elasmobranch fishes (sharks and rays), a group whose closest living outgroup, the holocephalan Ghost fishes, are separated from the elasmobranchs by more than 100 million years of evolution. We compiled a data set for analysis comprising 10 single-copy nuclear protein-coding genes (12096 bp) for representatives of the major lineages within elasmobranchs and holocephalans. For the simulation, we used an evolutionary model on a fixed tree topology to generate DNA sequence data sets which varied both in their distance to the outgroup, and in their base compositional difference between ingroup and outgroup. Results from both the empirical data set and the simulation, support the idea that deviation from base compositional stationarity, in conjunction with distance from the root can act in concert to compromise accuracy of estimated relationships within the ingroup. We tested several approaches to mitigate such problems. We found, that excluding genes with overall faster rates and heterogeneous base compositions, while the least sophisticated of the methods evaluated, seemed to be the most effective.},

	abstract = {Gene flow among populations or species and incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) are two evolutionary processes responsible for generating gene tree discordance and therefore hindering species tree estimation. Numerous studies have evaluated the impacts of ILS on species tree inference, yet the ramifications of gene flow on species trees remain less studied. Here, we simulate and analyse multilocus sequence data generated with ILS and gene flow to quantify their impacts on species tree inference. We characterize species tree estimation errors under various models of gene flow, such as the isolation-migration model, the n-island model, and gene flow between non-sister species or involving ancestral species, and species boundaries crossed by a single gene copy (allelic introgression) or by a single migrant individual. These patterns of gene flow are explored on species trees of different sizes (4 vs. 10 species), at different time scales (shallow vs. deep), and with different migration rates. Species trees are estimated with the multispecies coalescent model using Bayesian methods (BEST and *BEAST) and with a summary statistic approach (MPEST) that facilitates phylogenomic-scale analysis. Even in cases where the topology of the species tree is estimated with high accuracy, we find that gene flow can result in overestimates of population sizes (species tree dilation) and underestimates of species divergence times (species tree compression). Signatures of migration events remain present in the distribution of coalescent times for gene trees, and with sufficient data it is possible to identify those loci that have crossed species boundaries. These results highlight the need for careful sampling design in phylogeographic and species delimitation studies as gene flow, introgression, or incorrect sample assignments can bias the estimation of the species tree topology and of parameter estimates such as population sizes and divergence times.},

	abstract = {The protistan phylum Apicomplexa contains many important pathogens and is the subject of intense genome sequencing efforts. Based upon the genome sequences from seven apicomplexan species and a ciliate outgroup, we identified 268 single-copy genes suitable for phylogenetic inference. Both concatenation and consensus approaches inferred the same species tree topology. This topology is consistent with most prior conceptions of apicomplexan evolution based upon ultrastructural and developmental characters, that is, the piroplasm genera Theileria and Babesia form the sister group to the Plasmodium species, the coccidian genera Eimeria and Toxoplasma are monophyletic and are the sister group to the Plasmodium species and piroplasm genera, and Cryptosporidium forms the sister group to the above mentioned with the ciliate Tetrahymena as the outgroup. The level of incongruence among gene trees appears to be high at first glance; only 19\% of the genes support the species tree, and a total of 48 different gene-tree topologies are observed. Detailed investigations suggest that the low signal-to-noise ratio in many genes may be the main source of incongruence. The probability of being consistent with the species tree increases as a function of the minimum bootstrap support observed at tree nodes for a given gene tree. Moreover, gene sequences that generate high bootstrap support are robust to the changes in alignment parameters or phylogenetic method used. However, caution should be taken in that some genes can infer a "wrong" tree with strong support because of paralogy, model violations, or other causes. The importance of examining multiple, unlinked genes that possess a strong phylogenetic signal cannot be overstated.},

We identified and validated approximately 60,000 type-2-diabetes-associated markers and established the concept of a metagenomic linkage group, enabling taxonomic species-level analyses. MGWAS analysis showed that patients with type 2 diabetes were characterized by a moderate degree of gut microbial dysbiosis, a decrease in the abundance of some universal butyrate-producing bacteria and an increase in various opportunistic pathogens, as well as an enrichment of other microbial functions conferring sulphate reduction and oxidative stress resistance. An analysis of 23 additional individuals demonstrated that these gut microbial markers might be useful for classifying type 2 diabetes.},

Such methods are often PCR-based and hence require the availability of sequence data from the pathogen. Rattus norvegicus (R. norvegicus) is a known reservoir for important zoonotic pathogens. Transmission may be direct via contact with the animal, for example, through exposure to its faecal matter, or indirectly mediated by arthropod vectors. Here we investigated the viral content in rat faecal matter (n=29) collected from two continents by analyzing 2.2 billion next-generation sequencing reads derived from both DNA and RNA. Among other virus families, we found sequences from members of the Picornaviridae to be abundant in the microbiome of all the samples. Here we describe the diversity of the picornavirus-like contigs including near-full-length genomes closely related to the Boone cardiovirus and Theiler's encephalomyelitis virus. From this study, we conclude that picornaviruses within R. norvegicus are more diverse than previously recognized.

However, the recent advent of genome-scale phylogenomics has made the for- est of bird phylogenies even more complex and confusing. Here, in this perspective piece, I show that most parts of the avian Tree of Life are now firmly established as reproducible phylogenetic hypotheses. This is to the exception of the deepest relationships among Neoaves. Using phylogenetic networks and simulations, I argue that the very onset of the super-rapid neoavian radiation is irresolvable because of eight near-simultaneous speciation events. Such a hard polytomy of nine taxa translates into 2 027 025 possible rooted bifurcat- ing trees. Accordingly, recent genome-scale phylogenies show extremely complex conflicts in this (and only this) part of the avian Tree of Life. I predict that the upcoming years of avian phylogenomics will witness many more, highly conflicting tree topologies regarding the early neoavian polytomy. I further caution against bootstrapping in the era of genomics and suggest to instead use reproducibility (e.g. independent methods or data types) as sup- port for phylogenetic hypotheses. The early neoavian polytomy coincides with the Creta- ceous–Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction and is, to my knowledge, the first empirical example of a hard polytomy.},

	abstract = {In spite of substantial work and recent progress, a global and fully resolved picture of the macroevolutionary history of eukaryotes is still under construction. This concerns not only the phylogenetic relations among major groups, but also the general characteristics of the underlying macroevolutionary processes, including the patterns of gene family evolution associated with endosymbioses, as well as their impact on the sequence evolutionary process. All these questions raise formidable methodological challenges, calling for a more powerful statistical paradigm. In this direction, model-based probabilistic approaches have played an increasingly important role. In particular, improved models of sequence evolution accounting for heterogeneities across sites and across lineages have led to significant, although insufficient, improvement in phylogenetic accuracy. More recently, one main trend has been to move away from simple parametric models and stepwise approaches, towards integrative models explicitly considering the intricate interplay between multiple levels of macroevolutionary processes. Such integrative models are in their infancy, and their application to the phylogeny of eukaryotes still requires substantial improvement of the underlying models, as well as additional computational developments.},

The complete mitochondrial genome sequences from Anthozoa and recently from Porifera allow us to compare the resolution power of the 5′ partition, which has also been proposed as the standard marker for DNA barcoding, with a less frequently used partition further downstream.

	abstract = {Quantifying the dynamics of intrahost HIV-1 sequence evolution is one means of uncovering information about the interaction between HIV-1 and the host immune system. In the chronic phase of infection, common dynamics of sequence divergence and diversity have been reported. We developed an HIV-1 sequence evolution model that simulated the effects of mutation and fitness of sequence variants. The amount of evolution was described by the distance from the founder strain, and fitness was described by the number of offspring a parent sequence produces. Analysis of the model suggested that the previously observed saturation of divergence and decrease of diversity in later stages of infection can be explained by a decrease in the proportion of offspring that are mutants as the distance from the founder strain increases rather than due to an increase of viral fitness. The prediction of the model was examined by performing phylogenetic analysis to estimate the change in the rate of evolution during infection. In agreement with our modeling, in 13 out of 15 patients (followed for 3-12 years) we found that the rate of intrahost HIV-1 evolution was not constant but rather slowed down at a rate correlated with the rate of CD4+ T-cell decline. The correlation between the dynamics of the evolutionary rate and the rate of CD4+ T-cell decline, coupled with our HIV-1 sequence evolution model, explains previously conflicting observations of the relationships between the rate of HIV-1 quasispecies evolution and disease progression.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although it is agreed that a major polyploidy event, gamma, occurred within the eudicots, the phylogenetic placement of the event remains unclear.

RESULTS: To determine when this polyploidization occurred relative to speciation events in angiosperm history, we employed a phylogenomic approach to investigate the timing of gene set duplications located on syntenic gamma blocks. We populated 769 putative gene families with large sets of homologs obtained from public transcriptomes of basal angiosperms, magnoliids, asterids, and more than 91.8 gigabases of new next-generation transcriptome sequences of non-grass monocots and basal eudicots. The overwhelming majority (95\%) of well-resolved gamma duplications was placed before the separation of rosids and asterids and after the split of monocots and eudicots, providing strong evidence that the gamma polyploidy event occurred early in eudicot evolution. Further, the majority of gene duplications was placed after the divergence of the Ranunculales and core eudicots, indicating that the gamma appears to be restricted to core eudicots. Molecular dating estimates indicate that the duplication events were intensely concentrated around 117 million years ago.

CONCLUSIONS: The rapid radiation of core eudicot lineages that gave rise to nearly 75\% of angiosperm species appears to have occurred coincidentally or shortly following the gamma triplication event. Reconciliation of gene trees with a species phylogeny can elucidate the timing of major events in genome evolution, even when genome sequences are only available for a subset of species represented in the gene trees. Comprehensive transcriptome datasets are valuable complements to genome sequences for high-resolution phylogenomic analysis.},

	abstract = {Four New World genera of dwarf boas (Exiliboa, Trachyboa, Tropidophis, and Ungaliophis) have been placed by many systematists in a single group (traditionally called Tropidophiidae). However, the monophyly of this group has been questioned in several studies. Moreover, the overall relationships among basal snake lineages, including the placement of the dwarf boas, are poorly understood. We obtained mtDNA sequence data for 12S, 16S, and intervening tRNA-val genes from 23 species of snakes representing most major snake lineages, including all four genera of New World dwarf boas. We then examined the phylogenetic position of these species by estimating the phylogeny of the basal snakes. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that New World dwarf boas are not monophyletic. Instead, we find Exiliboa and Ungaliophis to be most closely related to sand boas (Erycinae), boas (Boinae), and advanced snakes (Caenophidea), whereas Tropidophis and Trachyboa form an independent clade that separated relatively early in snake radiation. Our estimate of snake phylogeny differs significantly in other ways from some previous estimates of snake phylogeny. For instance, pythons do not cluster with boas and sand boas, but instead show a strong relationship with Loxocemus and Xenopeltis. Additionally, uropeltids cluster strongly with Cylindrophis, and together are embedded in what has previously been considered the macrostomatan radiation. These relationships are supported by both bootstrapping (parametric and nonparametric approaches) and Bayesian analysis, although Bayesian support values are consistently higher than those obtained from nonparametric bootstrapping. Simulations show that Bayesian support values represent much better estimates of phylogenetic accuracy than do nonparametric bootstrap support values, at least under the conditions of our study.},

	abstract = {Understanding the evolution of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is crucial for reconstructing its origin, deciphering its interaction with the immune system and developing effective control strategies. Although it is clear that HIV-1 and HIV-2 originated in African primates, dating their transmission to humans is problematic, especially because of frequent recombination. Our ability to predict the spread of drug-resistance and immune-escape mutations depends on understanding how HIV evolution differs within and among hosts and on the role played by positive selection. For this purpose, extensive sampling of HIV genetic diversity is required, and is essential for informing the design of HIV vaccines. The present genetic diversity of HIV is the result of multiple cross-species transfers to humans from African non-human primates. HIV-1 has its origin in chimpanzees and is the result of three separate transfers to humans; by contrast, HIV-2 is most closely related to strains in the sooty mangabey and is the result of at least four transfers. The most recent common ancestor of HIV-1 group M (the virus that causes the vast majority of infections globally) is estimated to have existed in the 1930s, although more 'fossil' viruses are needed to confirm this. HIV-1 subtypes arise as the consequence of founder events and incomplete sampling. Over the course of an infection, positive natural selection is the dominant mode of HIV evolution within a single patient. Over the epidemic as a whole, stochastic processes are more important for the evolution of the virus between patients. There is little evidence that fitness differences among strains determine their population structure and distribution. Genetic recombination is a fundamental mechanism for the evolution of HIV. The development of drug treatments has greatly extended life expectancy and quality of life for those who are HIV positive but the development of drug resistance has been a major setback. Recombination can rapidly bring together resistance mutations for multiple drugs during combination therapy. The development of a vaccine for HIV has been a frustratingly slow process with the few candidate vaccines that have made it to phase III trials demonstrating no efficacy. The high rate of evolution means that the pattern of diversity of HIV is changing at an alarming rate.Vaccines are therefore aiming at a constantly moving target.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies are currently underway to characterize the microbial communities inhabiting our world. These studies aim to dramatically expand our understanding of the microbial biosphere and, more importantly, hope to reveal the secrets of the complex symbiotic relationship between us and our commensal bacterial microflora. An important prerequisite for such discoveries are computational tools that are able to rapidly and accurately compare large datasets generated from complex bacterial communities to identify features that distinguish them.We present a statistical method for comparing clinical metagenomic samples from two treatment populations on the basis of count data (e.g. as obtained through sequencing) to detect differentially abundant features. Our method, Metastats, employs the false discovery rate to improve specificity in high-complexity environments, and separately handles sparsely-sampled features using Fisher's exact test. Under a variety of simulations, we show that Metastats performs well compared to previously used methods, and significantly outperforms other methods for features with sparse counts. We demonstrate the utility of our method on several datasets including a 16S rRNA survey of obese and lean human gut microbiomes, COG functional profiles of infant and mature gut microbiomes, and bacterial and viral metabolic subsystem data inferred from random sequencing of 85 metagenomes. The application of our method to the obesity dataset reveals differences between obese and lean subjects not reported in the original study. For the COG and subsystem datasets, we provide the first statistically rigorous assessment of the differences between these populations. The methods described in this paper are the first to address clinical metagenomic datasets comprising samples from multiple subjects. Our methods are robust across datasets of varied complexity and sampling level. While designed for metagenomic applications, our software can also be applied to digital gene expression studies (e.g. SAGE). A web server implementation of our methods and freely available source code can be found at http://metastats.cbcb.umd.edu/.},

	abstract = {Regression testing is an expensive process used to validate modified software. Test case prioritization techniques improve the cost-effectiveness of regression testing by ordering test cases such that those that are more important are run earlier in the testing process. Many prioritization techniques have been proposed and evidence shows that they can be beneficial. It has been suggested, however, that the time constraints that can be imposed on regression testing by various software development processes can strongly affect the behavior of prioritization techniques. If this is correct, a better understanding of the effects of time constraints could lead to improved prioritization techniques and improved maintenance and testing processes. We therefore conducted a series of experiments to assess the effects of time constraints on the costs and benefits of prioritization techniques. Our first experiment manipulates time constraint levels and shows that time constraints do play a significant role in determining both the cost-effectiveness of prioritization and the relative cost-benefit trade-offs among techniques. Our second experiment replicates the first experiment, controlling for several threats to validity including numbers of faults present, and shows that the results generalize to this wider context. Our third experiment manipulates the number of faults present in programs to examine the effects of faultiness levels on prioritization and shows that faultiness level affects the relative cost-effectiveness of prioritization techniques. Taken together, these results have several implications for test engineers wishing to cost-effectively regression test their software systems. These include suggestions about when and when not to prioritize, what techniques to employ, and how differences in testing processes may relate to prioritization cost-effectiveness. © 2010 IEEE.},

The overwhelming majority of UK heterosexual infections are of non-B HIV subtypes, indicating viruses originating among immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa. The high rate of HIV evolution, combined with the availability of a very high density sample of viral sequences from routine clinical care has allowed the phylodynamics of the epidemic to be investigated for the first time. Sequences of the viral protease and partial reverse transcriptase coding regions from 11,071 patients infected with HIV of non-B subtypes were studied. Of these, 2774 were closely linked to at least one other sequence by nucleotide distance. Including the closest sequences from the global HIV database identified 296 individuals that were in UK-based groups of 3 or more individuals. There were a total of 8 UK-based clusters of 10 or more, comprising 143/2774 (5\%) individuals, much lower than the figure of 25\% obtained earlier for men who have sex with men (MSM). Sample dates were incorporated into relaxed clock phylogenetic analyses to estimate the dates of internal nodes. From the resulting time-resolved phylogenies, the internode lengths, used as estimates of maximum transmission intervals, had a median of 27 months overall, over twice as long as obtained for MSM (14 months), with only 2\% of transmissions occurring in the first 6 months after infection. This phylodynamic analysis of non-B subtype HIV sequences representing over 40\% of the estimated UK HIV-infected heterosexual population has revealed heterosexual HIV transmission in the UK is clustered, but on average in smaller groups and is transmitted with slower dynamics than among MSM. More effective intervention to restrict the epidemic may therefore be feasible, given effective diagnosis programmes.},

	abstract = {In this paper we study the problem of learning phylogenies and hidden Markov models. We call a Markov model nonsingular if all transition matri-ces have determinants bounded away from 0 (and 1). We highlight the role of the nonsingularity condition for the learning problem. Learning hidden Markov models without the nonsingularity condition is at least as hard as learning parity with noise, a well-known learning problem conjectured to be computationally hard. On the other hand, we give a polynomial-time algo-rithm for learning nonsingular phylogenies and hidden Markov models. 1. Introduction. In this paper we consider the problem of learning phyloge-nies and hidden Markov models, two of the most popular Markov models used in applications. Phylogenies are used in evolutionary biology to model the stochastic evolution of genetic data on the ancestral tree relating a group of species. More precisely, the leaves of the tree correspond to (known) extant species. Internal nodes represent extinct species, while the root of the tree represents the most recent ancestor to all species in the tree. Following paths from the root to the leaves, each bifurcation indicates a speciation event whereby two new species are created from a parent. The underlying assumption is that genetic information evolves from the root to the leaves according to a Markov model on the tree. This genetic information may consist of DNA sequences, proteins, and so on. Suppose, for example, that the genetic data consists of (aligned) DNA sequences and consider the evolution of the first letter in all sequences. This collection, named the first character, evolves according to Markov transition matrices on the edges. The root is assigned one of the four letters A, C, G and T . Then this letter evolves from parents to descendants according to the Markov matrices on the edges connecting them. The map from each node of the tree to the ith letter of the corresponding se-quence is called the ith character. It is further assumed that the characters are i.i.d.},

	abstract = {A gene family tree is traditionally inferred from a multiple alignment of homologous sequences according to a model of sequence evolution. Trees for several genes families are thus constructed independently from each other. They often carry unresolved parts or bad resolutions. Information for their full resolution may lie in the poorly exploited dependency between gene families, each bringing information for the resolution of the others. We propose to use several kinds of such dependencies in the construction of gene trees: information from a species tree through a model of gene content evolution by duplication, speciation and loss, information from extant synteny through ortholog predictions, and information from ancestral synteny through a model of gene neighborhood evolution. We develop several " correction " techniques, yielding a software package called " RefineTree ". We report some tests on simulated data and an application on the full set of gene families from the Ensembl database. We perform a genome-wide analysis of duplication and loss patterns on the history of 65 eukaryote species, including ancestral genes and gene orders of all ancestors along this phy-logeny. We show that according to several measures including running time, likelihood, stability of genome content and linearity of ancestral chromosomes, trees corrected by RefineTree are arguably more plausible than the ones stored by Ensembl. We finally discuss the quality criteria in the light of gene definition as a sequence or as a locus and extract some cases where a " true " gene tree should depend on this definition. RefineTree web interface is available at: Gene phylogenies on a whole genome scale are virtually useful to reconstruct ancestral genomes, including genes and gene orders, along with patterns of genome evolution. But the current standard gene trees stored in databases do not yet meet the sufficient quality for this aplicability. We propose a method to correct them, extensively test it, and apply it to the reconstruction of 64 eukaryote ancestral genomes (genes and gene orders when the evolutionary signal allows it).},

	abstract = {This study is the first to use a metagenomics approach to characterize the phylogeny and functional capacity of the canine gastrointestinal microbiome. Six healthy adult dogs were used in a crossover design and fed a low-fiber control diet (K9C) or one containing 7.5\% beet pulp (K9BP). Pooled fecal DNA samples from each treatment were subjected to 454 pyrosequencing, generating 503,280 (K9C) and 505,061 (K9BP) sequences. Dominant bacterial phyla included the Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group and Firmicutes, both of which comprised ∼35\% of all sequences, followed by Proteobacteria (13-15\%) and Fusobacteria (7-8\%). K9C had a greater percentage of Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria, whereas K9BP had greater proportions of the Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group and Firmicutes. Archaea were not altered by diet and represented ∼1\% of all sequences. All archaea were members of Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota, with methanogens being the most abundant and diverse. Three fungi phylotypes were present in K9C, but none in K9BP. Less than 0.4\% of sequences were of viral origin, with {\textgreater}99\% of them associated with bacteriophages. Primary functional categories were not significantly affected by diet and were associated with carbohydrates; protein metabolism; DNA metabolism; cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups and pigments; amino acids and derivatives; cell wall and capsule; and virulence. Hierarchical clustering of several gastrointestinal metagenomes demonstrated phylogenetic and metabolic similarity between dogs, humans and mice. More research is required to provide deeper coverage of the canine microbiome, evaluate effects of age, genetics or environment on its composition and activity, and identify its role in gastrointestinal disease.},

	abstract = {Rapid evolutionary radiations are expected to require large amounts of sequence data to resolve. To resolve these types of relationships many systematists believe that it will be necessary to collect data by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and use multispecies coalescent ('species tree') methods. Ultraconserved element (UCE) sequence capture is becoming a popular method to leverage the high throughput of NGS to address problems in vertebrate phylogenetics. Here we examine the performance of UCE data for gallopheasants (true pheasants and allies), a clade that underwent a rapid radiation 10-15 million years ago. Relationships among gallopheasant genera have been difficult to establish. We used this rapid radiation to assess the performance of species tree methods, using {\textasciitilde}600 kilobases of DNA sequence data from {\textasciitilde}1,500 UCEs. We also integrated information from traditional markers (nuclear intron data from 15 loci and three mitochondrial gene regions). Species tree methods exhibited troubling behavior. Two methods (MP-EST and ASTRAL) appeared to perform optimally when the set of input gene trees were limited to the most variable UCEs, though ASTRAL appeared to be more robust than MP-EST to input trees generated using less variable UCEs. In contrast, the rooted triplet consensus method implemented in Triplec performed better when the largest set of input gene trees was used. We also found that all three species tree methods exhibited a surprising degree of dependence on the program used to estimate input gene trees, suggesting that the details of likelihood calculations (e.g., numerical optimization) are important for loci with limited phylogenetic information. As an alternative to summary species tree methods we explored the performance of SMRT-ML, a concatenation method that is consistent even when gene trees exhibit topological differences due to the multispecies coalescent. We found that SMRT-ML performed well for UCE data. Our results suggest that UCE data have excellent prospects for the resolution of difficult evolutionary radiations, though specific attention may need to be given to the details of the methods used to estimate species trees.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The morphological peculiarities of turtles have, for a long time, impeded their accurate placement in the phylogeny of amniotes. Molecular data used to address this major evolutionary question have so far been limited to a handful of markers and/or taxa. These studies have supported conflicting topologies, positioning turtles as either the sister group to all other reptiles, to lepidosaurs (tuatara, lizards and snakes), to archosaurs (birds and crocodiles), or to crocodilians. Genome-scale data have been shown to be useful in resolving other debated phylogenies, but no such adequate dataset is yet available for amniotes.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to obtain seven new transcriptomes from the blood, liver, or jaws of four turtles, a caiman, a lizard, and a lungfish. We used a phylogenomic dataset based on 248 nuclear genes (187,026 nucleotide sites) for 16 vertebrate taxa to resolve the origins of turtles. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian concatenation analyses and species tree approaches performed under the most realistic models of the nucleotide and amino acid substitution processes unambiguously support turtles as a sister group to birds and crocodiles. The use of more simplistic models of nucleotide substitution for both concatenation and species tree reconstruction methods leads to the artefactual grouping of turtles and crocodiles, most likely because of substitution saturation at third codon positions. Relaxed molecular clock methods estimate the divergence between turtles and archosaurs around 255 million years ago. The most recent common ancestor of living turtles, corresponding to the split between Pleurodira and Cryptodira, is estimated to have occurred around 157 million years ago, in the Upper Jurassic period. This is a more recent estimate than previously reported, and questions the interpretation of controversial Lower Jurassic fossils as being part of the extant turtles radiation.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: These results provide a phylogenetic framework and timescale with which to interpret the evolution of the peculiar morphological, developmental, and molecular features of turtles within the amniotes.},

A system of priorities that reflects the value of taxonomic diversity can be achieved by setting priorities such that the subset of taxa that is protected has maximum underlying feature diversity. Such feature diversity of taxon subsets is difficult to estimate directly, but can be predicted by the cladistic/phylogenetic relationships among the taxa. In this study, a simple measure of phylogenetic diversity is defined based on cladistic information. The measure of phylogenetic diversity, PD, is contrasted with a measure of taxic diversity recently developed by Vane-Wright et al. (Biol. Conserv., 55, 1991). In re-examining reserve-selection scenarios based on a phylogeny of bumble bees (Apidae), PD produces quite different priorities for species conservation, relative to taxic diversity. The potential application of PD at levels below that of the species is then illustrated using a mtDNA phylogeny for populations of crested newts Triturus cristatus. Calculation of PD for different population subsets shows that protection of populations at either of two extremes of the geographic range of the group can significantly increase the phylogenetic diversity that is protected.},

Its accurate identification is one of the major challenges posed by reticulate evolution. In this article, we describe a new polynomial-time algorithm for inferring HGT events and compare 3 existing and 1 new tree comparison indices in the context of HGT identification. The proposed algorithm can rely on different optimization criteria, including least squares (LS), Robinson and Foulds (RF) distance, quartet distance (QD), and bipartition dissimilarity (BD), when searching for an optimal scenario of subtree prune and regraft (SPR) moves needed to transform the given species tree into the given gene tree. As the simulation results suggest, the algorithmic strategy based on BD, introduced in this article, generally provides better results than those based on LS, RF, and QD. The BD-based algorithm also proved to be more accurate and faster than a well-known polynomial time heuristic RIATA-HGT. Moreover, the HGT recovery results yielded by BD were generally equivalent to those provided by the exponential-time algorithm LatTrans, but a clear gain in running time was obtained using the new algorithm. Finally, a statistical framework for assessing the reliability of obtained HGTs by bootstrap analysis is also presented.},

	abstract = {Gene families are growing rapidly, but standard methods for inferring phylogenies do not scale to alignments with over 10,000 sequences. We present FastTree, a method for constructing large phylogenies and for estimating their reliability. Instead of storing a distance matrix, FastTree stores sequence profiles of internal nodes in the tree. FastTree uses these profiles to implement neighbor-joining and uses heuristics to quickly identify candidate joins. FastTree then uses nearest-neighbor interchanges to reduce the length of the tree. For an alignment with N sequences, L sites, and a different characters, a distance matrix requires O(N2) space and O(N2L) time, but FastTree requires just O() memory and O() time. To estimate the tree's reliability, FastTree uses local bootstrapping, which gives another 100-fold speedup over a distance matrix. For example, FastTree computed a tree and support values for 158,022 distinct 16S ribosomal RNAs in 17 hours and 2.4 gigabytes of memory. Just computing pairwise Jukes-Cantor distances and storing them, without inferring a tree or bootstrapping, would require 17 hours and 50 gigabytes of memory. In simulations, FastTree was slightly more accurate than neighbor joining, BIONJ, or FastME; on genuine alignments, FastTree's topologies had higher likelihoods.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Transmission patterns of sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) could relate to the structure of the underlying sexual contact network, whose features are therefore of interest to clinicians. Conventionally, we represent sexual contacts in a population with a graph, that can reveal the existence of communities. Phylogenetic methods help infer the history of an epidemic and incidentally, may help detecting communities. In particular, phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 epidemics among men who have sex with men (MSM) have revealed the existence of large transmission clusters, possibly resulting from within-community transmissions. Past studies have explored the association between contact networks and phylogenies, including transmission clusters, producing conflicting conclusions about whether network features significantly affect observed transmission history. As far as we know however, none of them thoroughly investigated the role of communities, defined with respect to the network graph, in the observation of clusters. METHODS The present study investigates, through simulations, community detection from phylogenies. We simulate a large number of epidemics over both unweighted and weighted, undirected random interconnected-islands networks, with islands corresponding to communities. We use weighting to modulate distance between islands. We translate each epidemic into a phylogeny, that lets us partition our samples of infected subjects into transmission clusters, based on several common definitions from the literature. We measure similarity between subjects' island membership indices and transmission cluster membership indices with the adjusted Rand index. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION Analyses reveal modest mean correspondence between communities in graphs and phylogenetic transmission clusters. We conclude that common methods often have limited success in detecting contact network communities from phylogenies. The rarely-fulfilled requirement that network communities correspond to clades in the phylogeny is their main drawback. Understanding the link between transmission clusters and communities in sexual contact networks could help inform policymaking to curb HIV incidence in MSMs.},

	abstract = {To provide a baseline biological comparison to simulation study predictions about the frequency of rogue taxa effects, we evaluated the frequency of a rogue taxa effect using viral data sets which differed in diversity. Using a quartet-tree framework, we measured the frequency of a rogue taxa effect in three data sets of increasing genetic variability (within viral serotype, between viral serotype, and between viral family) to test whether the rogue taxa was correlated with the mean sequence diversity of the respective data sets. We found a slight increase in the percentage of rogues as nucleotide diversity increased. Even though the number of rogues increased with diversity, the distribution of the types of rogues (friendly, crazy, or evil) did not depend on the diversity and in the case of the order-level data set the net rogue effect was slightly positive. This study, assessing frequency of the rogue taxa effect using biological data, indicated that simulation studies may over-predict the prevalence of the rogue taxa effect. Further investigations are necessary to understand which types of data sets are susceptible to a negative rogue effect and thus merit the removal of taxa from large phylogenetic reconstructions. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Determining protein function is one of the most important problems in the post-genomic era. For the typical proteome, there are no functional annotations for one-third or more of its proteins. Recent high-throughput experiments have determined proteome-scale protein physical interaction maps for several organisms. These physical interactions are complemented by an abundance of data about other types of functional relationships between proteins, including genetic interactions, knowledge about co-expression and shared evolutionary history. Taken together, these pairwise linkages can be used to build whole-proteome protein interaction maps.

RESULTS: We develop a network-flow based algorithm, FunctionalFlow, that exploits the underlying structure of protein interaction maps in order to predict protein function. In cross-validation testing on the yeast proteome, we show that FunctionalFlow has improved performance over previous methods in predicting the function of proteins with few (or no) annotated protein neighbors. By comparing several methods that use protein interaction maps to predict protein function, we demonstrate that FunctionalFlow performs well because it takes advantage of both network topology and some measure of locality. Finally, we show that performance can be improved substantially as we consider multiple data sources and use them to create weighted interaction networks.

Comparison of the locations of greater than 83 homologous loci revealed 13 conserved segments. Map distances between the outermost markers of these 13 segments are known for the mouse and range from 1 to 24 centimorgans. Methods were developed for using this sample of conserved segments to estimate the mean length of all conserved autosomal segments in the genome. This mean length was estimated to be 8.1 +/- 1.6 centimorgans. Evidence is presented suggesting that chromosomal rearrangements that determine the lengths of these segments are randomly distributed within the genome. The estimated mean length of conserved segments was used to predict the probability that certain loci, such as peptidase-3 and renin, are linked in man given that homologous loci are chi centimorgans apart in the mouse. The mean length of conserved segments was also used to estimate the number of chromosomal rearrangements that have disrupted linkage since divergence of man and mouse. This estimate was shown to be 178 +/- 39 rearrangements.},

These complex processes can be described through the comparison of homologous sequences in a phylogenetic framework. Moreover, phylogenetic inference provides sound statistical tools to exhibit the main features of molecular evolution from the analysis of actual sequences. This chapter focuses on phylogenetic tree estimation under the maximum likelihood (ML) principle. Phylogenies inferred under this probabilistic criterion are usually reliable and important biological hypotheses can be tested through the comparison of different models. Estimating ML phylogenies is computationally demanding, and careful examination of the results is warranted. This chapter focuses on PhyML, a software that implements recent ML phylogenetic methods and algorithms.

	abstract = {Gene trees record the combination of gene-level events, such as duplication, transfer and loss (DTL), and species-level events, such as speciation and extinction. Gene tree-species tree reconciliation methods model these processes by drawing gene trees into the species tree using a series of gene and species-level events. The reconstruction of gene trees based on sequence alone almost always involves choosing between statistically equivalent or weakly distinguishable relationships that could be much better resolved based on a putative species tree. To exploit this potential for accurate reconstruction of gene trees, the space of reconciled gene trees must be explored according to a joint model of sequence evolution and gene tree-species tree reconciliation. Here we present amalgamated likelihood estimation (ALE), a probabilistic approach to exhaustively explore all reconciled gene trees that can be amalgamated as a combination of clades observed in a sample of gene trees. We implement the ALE approach in the context of a reconciliation model (Szöllősi et al. 2013), which allows for the DTL of genes. We use ALE to efficiently approximate the sum of the joint likelihood over amalgamations and to find the reconciled gene tree that maximizes the joint likelihood among all such trees. We demonstrate using simulations that gene trees reconstructed using the joint likelihood are substantially more accurate than those reconstructed using sequence alone. Using realistic gene tree topologies, branch lengths, and alignment sizes, we demonstrate that ALE produces more accurate gene trees even if the model of sequence evolution is greatly simplified. Finally, examining 1099 gene families from 36 cyanobacterial genomes we find that joint likelihood-based inference results in a striking reduction in apparent phylogenetic discord, with respectively. 24\%, 59\%, and 46\% reductions in the mean numbers of duplications, transfers, and losses per gene family. The open source implementation of ALE is available from https://github.com/ssolo/ALE.git.},

the eubacteria that deserved the taxonomic status of a phylum. The
(partial) sequence of T. aquaticus rRNA appears relatively close
to those of other thermophilic eubacteria. e.g. Thermotoga maritima

a true evolutionary closeness; rather it is due to a "thermophilic
convergence", the result of unusually high G+C composition in the
rRNAs of thermophilic bacteria. Unless such compositional biases

Our full genomic data set resolves relationships within the genus that were previously intractable. Subsampling the data reveals considerable variation in phylogenetic signal and power in smaller subsets of the data. Even when sampling 5000 sites, no random sample of the data supports a topology identical to that of the genome-wide phylogeny.

	abstract = {In the mid-2000s, molecular phylogenetics turned into phylogenomics, a development that improved the resolution of phylogenetic trees through a dramatic reduction in stochastic error. While some then predicted “the end of incongruence”, it soon appeared that analysing large amounts of sequence data without an adequate model of sequence evolution amplifies systematic error and leads to phylogenetic artefacts. With the increasing flood of (sometimes low-quality) genomic data resulting from the rise of high-throughput sequencing, a new type of error has emerged. Termed here “data errors”, it lumps together several kinds of issues affecting the construction of phylogenomic supermatrices (e.g., sequencing and annotation errors, contaminant sequences). While easy to deal with at a single-gene scale, such errors become very difficult to avoid at the genomic scale, both because hand curating thousands of sequences is prohibitively time-consuming and because the suitable automated bioinformatics tools are still in their infancy. In this paper, we first review the pitfalls affecting the construction of supermatrices and the strategies to limit their adverse effects on phylogenomic inference. Then, after discussing the relative non-issue of missing data in supermatrices, we briefly present the approaches commonly used to reduce systematic error.},

We combine anchored enrichment next-generation sequencing with species tree analyses to produce a robust estimate of phylogenetic relationships in the genus Protea (Proteaceae), an iconic radiation in South Africa. METHODS We sampled multiple individuals within 59 out of 112 species of Protea and 6 outgroup species for a total of 163 individuals, and obtained sequences for 498 low-copy, orthologous nuclear loci using anchored phylogenomics. We compare several approaches for building species trees, and explore gene tree-species tree discrepancies to determine whether poor phylogenetic resolution reflects a lack of informative sites, incomplete lineage sorting, or hybridization. KEY RESULTS Phylogenetic estimates from species tree approaches are similar to one another and recover previously well-supported clades within Protea, in addition to providing well-supported phylogenetic hypotheses for previously poorly resolved intrageneric relationships. Individual gene trees are markedly different from one another and from species trees. Nonetheless, analyses indicate that differences among gene trees occur primarily concerning clades supported by short branches. CONCLUSIONS Species tree methods using hundreds of nuclear loci provided strong support for many previously unresolved relationships in the radiation of the genus Protea. In cases where support for particular relationships remains low, these appear to arise from few informative sites and lack of information rather than strongly supported disagreement among gene trees.},

First we constructed SOMs of tri- and tetranucleotide frequencies from a total of 3.3-Gb of sequences derived using 113 prokaryotic and 13 eukaryotic genomes, for which complete genome sequences are available. SOMs classified the 330000 10-kb sequences from these genomes mainly according to species without information on the species. Importantly, classification was possible without orthologous sequence sets and thus was useful for studies of novel sequences from poorly characterized species such as those living only under extreme conditions and which have attracted wide scientific and industrial attention. Using the SOM method, sequences that were derived from a single genome but cloned independently in a metagenome library could be reassociated in silico. The usefulness of SOMs in metagenome studies was also discussed.},

Formal phylogeographic methods have not yet been applied to the molecular epidemiology of bacterial pathogens because the limited genetic diversity of data sets based on individual genes usually results in poor phylogenetic resolution. Here, we investigated a whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data set of health care-associated Methicillin-resistant S. aureus sequence type 239 (HA-MRSA ST239) strains, which we analyzed using Markov spatial models that incorporate geographical sampling distributions. The reconstructed timescale indicated a temporal origin of this strain shortly after the introduction of Methicillin, followed by global pandemic spread. The estimate of the temporal origin was robust to the molecular clock, coalescent prior, full/intergenic/synonymous SNP inclusion, and correction for excluded invariant site patterns. Finally, phylogeographic analyses statistically supported the role of human movement in the global dissemination of HA-MRSA ST239, although it was unable to conclusively resolve the location of the root. This study demonstrates that bacterial genomes can indeed contain sufficient evolutionary information to elucidate the temporal and spatial dynamics of transmission. Future applications of this approach to other bacterial strains may provide valuable epidemiological insights that may justify the cost of genome-wide typing.},

However, these studies rely heavily on samples from captive individuals and often confound host phylogeny, gut morphology, and diet. To more explicitly test the influence of host dietary niche on the mammalian gut microbiome we use 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics to compare the gut microbiota of 18 species of wild non-human primates classified as either folivores or closely related non-folivores, evenly distributed throughout the primate order and representing a range of gut morphological specializations. While folivory results in some convergent microbial traits, collectively we show that the influence of host phylogeny on both gut microbial composition and function is much stronger than that of host dietary niche. This pattern does not result from differences in host geographic location or actual dietary intake at the time of sampling, but instead appears to result from of differences in host physiology. These findings indicate that mammalian gut microbiome plasticity in response to dietary shifts over both the lifespan of an individual host and the evolutionary history of a given host species is constrained by host physiological evolution. Therefore, the gut microbiome cannot be considered separately from host physiology when describing host nutritional strategies and the emergence of host dietary niches.},

	abstract = {Coalescent theory is routinely used to estimate past population dynamics and demographic parameters from genealogies. While early work in coalescent theory only considered simple demographic models, advances in theory have allowed for increasingly complex demographic scenarios to be considered. The success of this approach has lead to coalescent-based inference methods being applied to populations with rapidly changing population dynamics, including pathogens like RNA viruses. However, fitting epidemiological models to genealogies via coalescent models remains a challenging task, because pathogen populations often exhibit complex, nonlinear dynamics and are structured by multiple factors. Moreover, it often becomes necessary to consider stochastic variation in population dynamics when fitting such complex models to real data. Using recently developed structured coalescent models that accommodate complex population dynamics and population structure, we develop a statistical framework for fitting stochastic epidemiological models to genealogies. By combining particle filtering methods with Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, we are able to fit a wide class of stochastic, nonlinear epidemiological models with different forms of population structure to genealogies. We demonstrate our framework using two structured epidemiological models: a model with disease progression between multiple stages of infection and a two-population model reflecting spatial structure. We apply the multi-stage model to HIV genealogies and show that the proposed method can be used to estimate the stage-specific transmission rates and prevalence of HIV. Finally, using the two-population model we explore how much information about population structure is contained in genealogies and what sample sizes are necessary to reliably infer parameters like migration rates.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Advances in DNA sequence-based technologies now permit genetic analysis of complex microbial populations without the need for prior cultivation. This review summarizes the molecular methods of culture-independent microbiology ('metagenomics') and their recent application to studies of the human gastrointestinal tract in both health and disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Culture-independent metagenomic surveys reveal unprecedented microbial biodiversity in the human intestine. Upwards of 40,000 bacterial species are estimated to comprise the collective gastrointestinal microbiome, most of which have not been characterized by culture. Diverse conditions such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, obesity, and pouchitis have been correlated with large-scale imbalances in gastrointestinal microbiota, or 'dysbiosis'. These findings demonstrate the importance of commensal microorganisms in maintaining gastrointestinal health. SUMMARY: Through technological and conceptual innovations in metagenomics, the complex microbial habitat of the human gastrointestinal tract is now amenable to detailed ecological analysis. Large-scale shifts in gut commensal populations, rather than occurrence of particular microorganisms, are associated with several gastroenterological conditions; redress of these imbalances may ameliorate the conditions.},

	abstract = {Partitioned Bayesian analyses of approximately 2.2 kb of nucleotide sequence data (mtDNA) were used to elucidate phylogenetic relationships among 30 scincid lizard genera. Few partitioned Bayesian analyses exist in the literature, resulting in a lack of methods to determine the appropriate number of and identity of partitions. Thus, a criterion, based on the Bayes factor, for selecting among competing partitioning strategies is proposed and tested. Improvements in both mean -lnL and estimated posterior probabilities were observed when specific models and parameter estimates were assumed for partitions of the total data set. This result is expected given that the 95\% credible intervals of model parameter estimates for numerous partitions do not overlap and it reveals that different data partitions may evolve quite differently. We further demonstrate that how one partitions the data (by gene, codon position, etc.) is shown to be a greater concern than simply the overall number of partitions. Using the criterion of the 2 ln Bayes factor {\textgreater} 10, the phylogenetic analysis employing the largest number of partitions was decisively better than all other strategies. Strategies that partitioned the ND1 gene by codon position performed better than other partition strategies, regardless of the overall number of partitions. Scincidae, Acontinae, Lygosominae, east Asian and North American "Eumeces" + Neoseps; North African Eumeces, Scincus, and Scincopus, and a large group primarily from sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, and neighboring islands are monophyletic. Feylinia, a limbless group of previously uncertain relationships, is nested within a "scincine" clade from sub-Saharan Africa. We reject the hypothesis that the nearly limbless dibamids are derived from within the Scincidae, but cannot reject the hypothesis that they represent the sister taxon to skinks. Amphiglossus, Chalcides, the acontines Acontias and Typhlosaurus, and Scincinae are paraphyletic. The globally widespread "Eumeces" is polyphyletic and we make necessary taxonomic changes.},

	abstract = {The genealogical relationship of human, chimpanzee, and gorilla varies along the genome. We develop a hidden Markov model (HMM) that incorporates this variation and relate the model parameters to population genetics quantities such as speciation times and ancestral population sizes. Our HMM is an analytically tractable approximation to the coalescent process with recombination, and in simulations we see no apparent bias in the HMM estimates. We apply the HMM to four autosomal contiguous human-chimp-gorilla-orangutan alignments comprising a total of 1.9 million base pairs. We find a very recent speciation time of human-chimp (4.1 +/- 0.4 million years), and fairly large ancestral effective population sizes (65,000 +/- 30,000 for the human-chimp ancestor and 45,000 +/- 10,000 for the human-chimp-gorilla ancestor). Furthermore, around 50\% of the human genome coalesces with chimpanzee after speciation with gorilla. We also consider 250,000 base pairs of X-chromosome alignments and find an effective population size much smaller than 75\% of the autosomal effective population sizes. Finally, we find that the rate of transitions between different genealogies correlates well with the region-wide present-day human recombination rate, but does not correlate with the fine-scale recombination rates and recombination hot spots, suggesting that the latter are evolutionarily transient.},

Parity mode is also associated with variable diversification rates in some groups. We reconstruct ancestral parity modes accounting for state-dependent diversification in a large-scale phylogenetic analysis, and find strong support for an early origin of viviparity at the base of Squamata, and a complex pattern of subsequent transitions. Viviparous lineages have higher rates of speciation and extinction, and greater species turnover through time. Viviparity is associated with lower environmental and body temperatures in lizards and amphisbaenians, but not female mass. These results suggest that parity mode is a labile trait that shifts frequently in response to ecological conditions.},

Furthermore, the placement of iguanian lizards has remained controversial. Here we used targeted sequence capture to obtain data from 4178 nuclear loci from ultraconserved elements from 32 squamate taxa (and five outgroups) including representatives of all major squamate groups. Using both concatenated and species-tree methods, we recover strong support for a sister relationship between iguanian and anguimorph lizards, with snakes strongly supported as the sister group of these two clades. These analyses strongly resolve the difficult placement of snakes within squamates and show overwhelming support for the contentious position of iguanians. More generally, we provide a strongly supported hypothesis of higher-level relationships in the most species-rich tetrapod clade using coalescent-based species-tree methods and approximately 100 times more loci than previous estimates.},

	isbn = {978-0-387-31073-2},
	abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. The author's previous textbook "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.},

METHODS AND FINDINGS The HPTN 071 (PopART) trial is a three-arm cluster-randomized trial of 21 large population clusters in Zambia and South Africa, starting in 2013. A combination prevention package including home-based voluntary testing and counseling, and ART for HIV positive individuals, will be delivered in arms A and B, with ART offered universally in arm A and according to national guidelines in arm B. Arm C will be the control arm. The primary endpoint is the cumulative three-year HIV incidence. We developed a mathematical model of heterosexual HIV transmission, informed by recent data on HIV-1 natural history. We focused on realistically modeling the intervention package. Parameters were calibrated to data previously collected in these communities and national surveillance data. We predict that, if targets are reached, HIV incidence over three years will drop by {\textgreater}60\% in arm A and {\textgreater}25\% in arm B, relative to arm C. The considerable uncertainty in the predicted reduction in incidence justifies the need for a trial. The main drivers of this uncertainty are possible community-level behavioral changes associated with the intervention, uptake of testing and treatment, as well as ART retention and adherence. CONCLUSIONS The HPTN 071 (PopART) trial intervention could reduce HIV population-level incidence by {\textgreater}60\% over three years. This intervention could serve as a paradigm for national or supra-national implementation. Our analysis highlights the role mathematical modeling can play in trial development and monitoring, and more widely in evaluating the impact of treatment as prevention.},

	abstract = {A versatile method, quartet puzzling, is introduced to reconstruct the topology (branching pattern) of a phylogenetic tree based on DNA or amino acid sequence data. This method applies maximum-likelihood tree reconstruction to all possible quartets that can be formed from n sequences. The quartet trees serve as starting points to reconstruct a set of optimal n-taxon trees. The majority rule consensus of these trees defines the quartet puzzling tree and shows groupings that are well supported. Computer simulations show that the performance of quartet puzzling to reconstruct the true tree is always equal to or better than that of neighbor joining. For some cases with high transition/transversion bias quartet puzzling outperforms neighbor joining by a factor of 10. The application of quartet puzzling to mitochondrial RNA and tRNA(Val) sequences from amniotes demonstrates the power of the approach. A PHYLIP-compatible ANSI C program, PUZZLE, for analyzing nucleotide or amino acid sequence data is available. [References: 21]},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Species tree estimation is challenging in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), which can make gene trees different from the species tree. Because ILS is expected to occur and the standard concatenation approach can return incorrect trees with high support in the presence of ILS, "coalescent-based" summary methods (which first estimate gene trees and then combine gene trees into a species tree) have been developed that have theoretical guarantees of robustness to arbitrarily high amounts of ILS. Some studies have suggested that summary methods should only be used on "c-genes" (i.e., recombination-free loci) that can be extremely short (sometimes fewer than 100 sites). However, gene trees estimated on short alignments can have high estimation error, and summary methods tend to have high error on short c-genes. To address this problem, Chifman and Kubatko introduced SVDquartets, a new coalescent-based method. SVDquartets takes multi-locus unlinked single-site data, infers the quartet trees for all subsets of four species, and then combines the set of quartet trees into a species tree using a quartet amalgamation heuristic. Yet, the relative accuracy of SVDquartets to leading coalescent-based methods has not been assessed.RESULTS:We compared SVDquartets to two leading coalescent-based methods (ASTRAL-2 and NJst), and to concatenation using maximum likelihood. We used a collection of simulated datasets, varying ILS levels, numbers of taxa, and number of sites per locus. Although SVDquartets was sometimes more accurate than ASTRAL-2 and NJst, most often the best results were obtained using ASTRAL-2, even on the shortest gene sequence alignments we explored (with only 10 sites per locus). Finally, concatenation was the most accurate of all methods under low ILS conditions.CONCLUSIONS:ASTRAL-2 generally had the best accuracy under higher ILS conditions, and concatenation had the best accuracy under the lowest ILS conditions. However, SVDquartets was competitive with the best methods under conditions with low ILS and small numbers of sites per locus. The good performance under many conditions of ASTRAL-2 in comparison to SVDquartets is surprising given the known vulnerability of ASTRAL-2 and similar methods to short gene sequences.},

	abstract = {A fundamental task in sequence analysis is to calculate the probability of a multiple alignment given a phylogenetic tree relating the sequences and an evolutionary model describing how sequences change over time. However, the most widely used phylogenetic models only account for residue substitution events. We describe a probabilistic model of a multiple sequence alignment that accounts for insertion and deletion events in addition to substitutions, given a phylogenetic tree, using a rate matrix augmented by the gap character. Starting from a continuous Markov process, we construct a non-reversible generative (birth-death) evolutionary model for insertions and deletions. The model assumes that insertion and deletion events occur one residue at a time. We apply this model to phylogenetic tree inference by extending the program dnaml in phylip. Using standard benchmarking methods on simulated data and a new "concordance test" benchmark on real ribosomal RNA alignments, we show that the extended program dnamlepsilon improves accuracy relative to the usual approach of ignoring gaps, while retaining the computational efficiency of the Felsenstein peeling algorithm.},

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10908645},
	abstract = {In phylogenetic inference by maximum-parsimony (MP), minimum-evolution (ME), and maximum-likelihood (ML) methods, it is customary to conduct extensive heuristic searches of MP, ME, and ML trees, examining a large number of different topologies. However, these extensive searches tend to give incorrect tree topologies. Here we show by extensive computer simulation that when the number of nucleotide sequences (m) is large and the number of nucleotides used (n) is relatively small, the simple MP or ML tree search algorithms such as the stepwise addition (SA) plus nearest neighbor interchange (NNI) search and the SA plus subtree pruning regrafting (SPR) search are as efficient as the extensive search algorithms such as the SA plus tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) search in inferring the true tree. In the case of ME methods, the simple neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm is as efficient as or more efficient than the extensive NJ+TBR search. We show that when ME methods are used, the simple p distance generally gives better results in phylogenetic inference than more complicated distance measures such as the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY) distance, even when nucleotide substitution follows the HKY model. When ML methods are used, the simple Jukes-Cantor (JC) model of phylogenetic inference generally shows a better performance than the HKY model even if the likelihood value for the HKY model is much higher than that for the JC model. This indicates that at least in the present case, selecting of a substitution model by using the likelihood ratio test or the AIC index is not appropriate. When n is small relative to m and the extent of sequence divergence is high, the NJ method with p distance often shows a better performance than ML methods with the JC model. However, when the level of sequence divergence is low, this is not the case.},

	abstract = {The molecular era has fundamentally reshaped our knowledge of the evolution and diversification of angiosperms. One outstanding question is the phylogenetic placement of Amborella trichopoda Baill., commonly thought to represent the first lineage of extant angiosperms. Here, we leverage publicly available data and provide a broad coalescent-based species tree estimation of 45 seed plants. By incorporating 310 nuclear genes, our coalescent analyses strongly support a clade containing Amborella plus water lilies (i.e., Nymphaeales) that is sister to all other angiosperms across different nucleotide rate partitions. Our results also show that commonly applied concatenation methods produce strongly supported, but incongruent placements of Amborella: slow-evolving nucleotide sites corroborate results from coalescent analyses, whereas fast-evolving sites place Amborella alone as the first lineage of extant angiosperms. We further explored the performance of coalescent versus concatenation methods using nucleotide sequences simulated on (i) the two alternate placements of Amborella with branch lengths and substitution model parameters estimated from each of the 310 nuclear genes and (ii) three hypothetical species trees that are topologically identical except with respect to the degree of deep coalescence and branch lengths. Our results collectively suggest that the Amborella alone placement inferred using concatenation methods is likely misled by fast-evolving sites. This appears to be exacerbated by the combination of long branches in stem group angiosperms, Amborella, and Nymphaeales with the short internal branch separating Amborella and Nymphaeales. In contrast, coalescent methods appear to be more robust to elevated substitution rates.},

	abstract = {Microbial communities carry out the majority of the biochemical activity on the planet, and they play integral roles in processes including metabolism and immune homeostasis in the human microbiome. Shotgun sequencing of such communities' metagenomes provides information complementary to organismal abundances from taxonomic markers, but the resulting data typically comprise short reads from hundreds of different organisms and are at best challenging to assemble comparably to single-organism genomes. Here, we describe an alternative approach to infer the functional and metabolic potential of a microbial community metagenome. We determined the gene families and pathways present or absent within a community, as well as their relative abundances, directly from short sequence reads. We validated this methodology using a collection of synthetic metagenomes, recovering the presence and abundance both of large pathways and of small functional modules with high accuracy. We subsequently applied this method, HUMAnN, to the microbial communities of 649 metagenomes drawn from seven primary body sites on 102 individuals as part of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP). This provided a means to compare functional diversity and organismal ecology in the human microbiome, and we determined a core of 24 ubiquitously present modules. Core pathways were often implemented by different enzyme families within different body sites, and 168 functional modules and 196 metabolic pathways varied in metagenomic abundance specifically to one or more niches within the microbiome. These included glycosaminoglycan degradation in the gut, as well as phosphate and amino acid transport linked to host phenotype (vaginal pH) in the posterior fornix. An implementation of our methodology is available at http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/humann. This provides a means to accurately and efficiently characterize microbial metabolic pathways and functional modules directly from high-throughput sequencing reads, enabling the determination of community roles in the HMP cohort and in future metagenomic studies.},

Metamorphosis was long regarded as plesiomorphic for plethodontids, yet the genus Desmognathus, which primarily includes metamorphosing species, is now nested within a much larger clade of direct-developing species. The extent to which the putative reacquisition of metamorphosis in Desmognathus represents a true evolutionary reversal is contingent upon the extent to which both larva-specific features and metamorphosis were actually lost during the evolution of direct development. In this study we analyze development of the hyobranchial skeleton, which is dramatically remodeled during salamander metamorphosis, in the direct-developing red-backed salamander, Plethodon cinereus. We find dramatic remodeling of the hyobranchial skeleton during embryogenesis in P. cinereus and the transient appearance of larva-specific cartilages. Hyobranchial development in this direct-developing plethodontid is highly similar to that in metamorphosing plethodontids (e.g., Desmognathus). The proposed reacquisition of hyobranchial metamorphosis within Desmognathus does not represent the "re-evolution" of a lost phenotype, but instead the elaboration of an existing developmental sequence.},

LLV has been associated with virologic failure of HAART in some studies, while in others LLV did not appear to affect the clinical outcome. To understand the processes leading to LLV, genetic analyses were used to determine whether plasma virions emanated from archived or from newly evolved viral genomes. Episodes of LLV (plasma HIV-1 RNA, 50 to 379 [median, 77] c/ml) were detected in 21/37 (57\%) HIV-1-infected children with median plasma HIV-1 RNA levels of {\textless}50 c/ml during 79 patient years of HAART. Viral sequences were derived by direct sequencing of PCR products from 21 plasma specimens diluted to end point. In phylogenetic analysis, LLV viral sequences grouped with virus from early in the course of infection in 8/11 subjects. Six specimens had multiple identical viral sequences, suggesting origin from clonally expanded infected cells. LLV plasma virus evolved over time, indicating viral replication, in 3/11 subjects. Two of these had frequent LLV, including the selection of drug-resistant mutants. In summary, plasma virus from episodes of LLV during effective HAART appeared to originate from two distinct processes, (i) clonal outgrowth from long-lived HIV-1-infected cells, presumably following activation and proliferation of these cells, and (ii) ongoing viral replication that included the selection of new drug-resistant mutants. These observations provide a plausible explanation for the divergent clinical outcomes previously associated with LLV.},

Our results show an unexpected range of beta-diversity in human stool microbiomes compared to environmental samples; demonstrate the utility of procedures for removing the effects of overgrowth during room-temperature shipping for revealing phenotype correlations; uncover new molecules and kinds of molecular communities in the human stool metabolome; and examine emergent associations among the microbiome, metabolome, and the diversity of plants that are consumed (rather than relying on reductive categorical variables such as veganism, which have little or no explanatory power). We also demonstrate the utility of the living data resource and cross-cohort comparison to confirm existing associations between the microbiome and psychiatric illness and to reveal the extent of microbiome change within one individual during surgery, providing a paradigm for open microbiome research and education.},

Unfortunately, multi-gene analyses have yielded highly incongruent results, suggesting, for instance, Charales [1], Zygnematales [2,3], or Coleochaete [4] as the sister-group of land plants. Such controversy may result from the real history of life, in particular closely spaced speciation events, incomplete lineage sorting, gene duplication or horizontal gene transfer. In such cases, the solution resides in improved taxon sampling and sophisticated models of evolution [5]. However, we will show that the quality of data used to infer the phylogeny may also play a major role. In particular, the inclusion of contaminant sequences from other species, and of genes with incomplete taxon sampling explains a large part of the discrepancies observed between various studies [2-4]. The use of a carefully checked and almost complete dataset suggests that land plants are closely related to a group composed of Zygnematales and Coleochaetales. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Although phylogenetic hypotheses can provide insights into mechanisms of evolution, their utility is limited by our inability to differentiate simultaneous speciation events (hard polytomies) from rapid cladogenesis (soft polytomies). In the present paper, we tested the potential for statistical power analysis to differentiate between hard and soft: polytomies in molecular phylogenies. Classical power analysis typically is used a priori to determine the sample size required to detect a particular effect size at a particular level of significance (alpha) with a certain power (1 - beta). A posteriori, power analysis is used to infer whether failure to reject a null hypothesis results from lack of an effect or from insufficient data (i.e., low power). We adapted this approach to molecular data to infer whether polytomies result from simultaneous branching events or from insufficient sequence information. We then used this approach to determine the amount of sequence data (sample size) required to detect a positive branch length (effect size). A worked example is provided based on the auklets (Charadriiformes: Alcidae), a group of seabirds among which relationships are represented by a polytomy, despite analyses of over 3000 bp of sequence data. We demonstrate the calculation of effect sizes and sample sizes from sequence data using a normal curve test for difference of a proportion from an expected value and a t-test for a difference of a mean from an expected value. Power analyses indicated that the data for the auklets should be sufficient to differentiate speciation events that occurred at least 100,000 yr apart (the duration of the shortest glacial and interglacial events of the Pleistocene), 2.6 million years ago.},

Given this solution, we then use non-parametric statistics to find an outlier set of taxa that have an unexpectedly high impact on the tree diameter. We test our method, TreeShrink, on five biological datasets, and show that it is more conservative than rogue taxon removal using RogueNaRok.

Despite this gap in understanding, high-throughput antibody sequence data are increasingly being collected to investigate the evolutionary trajectories of antibody lineages in HIV-infected individuals. Here, we review what is known in controlled experimental systems about the mechanisms underlying antibody selection and compare this to the observed temporal patterns of antibody evolution in HIV infection. We describe how our current understanding of antibody selection mechanisms leaves questions about antibody dynamics in HIV infection unanswered. Without a mechanistic understanding of antibody selection in the context of a co-evolving viral population, modelling and analysis of antibody sequences in HIV-infected individuals will be limited in their interpretation and predictive ability.},

A computerized method that eliminates such positions and at the same time tries to minimize the loss of informative sites is presented here. The method is based on the selection of blocks of positions that fulfill a simple set of requirements with respect to the number of contiguous conserved positions, lack of gaps, and high conservation of flanking positions, making the final alignment more suitable for phylogenetic analysis. To illustrate the efficiency of this method, alignments of 10 mitochondrial proteins from several completely sequenced mitochondrial genomes belonging to diverse eukaryotes were used as examples. The percentages of removed positions were higher in the most divergent alignments. After removing divergent segments, the amino acid composition of the different sequences was more uniform, and pairwise distances became much smaller. Phylogenetic trees show that topologies can be different after removing conserved blocks, particularly when there are several poorly resolved nodes. Strong support was found for the grouping of animals and fungi but not for the position of more basal eukaryotes. The use of a computerized method such as the one presented here reduces to a certain extent the necessity of manually editing multiple alignments, makes the automation of phylogenetic analysis of large data sets feasible, and facilitates the reproduction of the final alignment by other researchers.},

	abstract = {As DNA sequences have become more readily available, it has become increasingly desirable to infer species phylogenies from multigene data sets. Much recent work has centered around the recognition that substantial incongruence in single-gene phylogenies necessitates the development of statistical procedures to estimate species phylogenies that appropriately model the process of evolution at the level of the individual genes. One process that gives rise to variation in the histories of individual genes is incomplete lineage sorting, which is commonly modeled by the coalescent, and thus much current work is focused on proper estimation of species phylogenies under the coalescent model. A second common source of discord in single-gene phylogenies is hybridization, a process that is ubiquitous in many groups of plants and animals. Although methods to incorporate hybridization into phylogenetic estimation have also been developed, only a handful of methods that address both coalescence and hybridization have been proposed. Here, I propose an extension of an existing model that incorporates both of these processes simultaneously by utilizing gene trees for inference in a likelihood framework. The model allows examination of the evidence for hybridization in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting due to deep coalescence via model selection using standard information criteria (e.g., Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion). The potential of the method is evaluated using simulated data.},

	abstract = {© 2018 The Royal Entomological Society. Mimallonidae, the sack-bearer moths, are a family of predominantly Neotropical moths containing nearly 300 described species. Mimallonidae feed on over 40 host plant families and are found in a variety of environments, but phylogenetic relationships of species within the family have never been investigated. We sequenced 515 loci using anchored hybrid enrichment target capture on ethanol-preserved and dried museum specimens, with dates of collection ranging from 1985 to 2017. We sampled 47 species, representing 32 of the 36 described mimallonid genera. By incorporating 19 dry museum specimens, and recovering an average of over 400 loci for each, we illustrate the utility of natural history collections in anchored hybrid enrichment-based phylogenomics. Maximum likelihood and multi-species coalescent analyses provide robust support for the recognition of six higher-level groups within Mimallonidae, which we designate as subfamilies: Zaphantinae St Laurent  \&  Kawahara subfam.n., Aurorianinae St Laurent  \&  Kawahara subfam.n., Mimalloninae Burmeister, Lacosominae Dyar, Druenticinae St Laurent  \&  Kawahara subfam.n. and Cicinninae Schaus stat.n. Our phylogenetic results also robustly support eight new tribes: Lacosominae: Trogopterini St Laurent  \&  Kawahara tribe n., Lacosomini Dyar stat.n., Alheitini St Laurent  \&  Kawahara tribe n.; Druenticinae: Luramini St Laurent  \&  Kawahara tribe n., Druenticini St Laurent  \&  Kawahara tribe n.; Cicinninae: Bedosiini St Laurent  \&  Kawahara tribe n., Psychocampini St Laurent  \&  Kawahara tribe n., Cicinnini Schaus stat.n. Three new genera are also described based on our phylogenetic results: Herbinalla St Laurent  \&  Kawahara, gen.n., Ulaluma St Laurent  \&  Kawahara, gen.n., Bedosiallo St Laurent  \&  Kawahara, gen.n. Naniteta Franclemont, syn.n. is a synonym of Lacosoma Grote. Six genera are paraphyletic, and in total 19 new combinations are proposed: Macessoga laxa comb.n., Lacosoma elassa comb.n., Thaelia anysia comb.n., Thaelia subrubiginosa comb.n., Herbinalla caudina comb.n., Druentica brosica comb.n., Ulaluma valva comb.n., Cicinnus eminens comb.n., Roelmana pluridiscata comb.n., Roelmana laguerrei comb.n., Psychocampa joanna comb.n., Psychocampa unalca comb.n., Psychocampa hamata comb.n., Psychocampa marona comb.n., Bedosiallo eugenia comb.n., Bedosiallo forbesi comb.n., Bedosiallo moengus comb.n., Bedosiallo styx comb.n. and Bedosiallo sylvia comb.n. This study is the first to implement the LEP1 probe set on a comprehensive taxonomic dataset that includes many museum specimens, and our results demonstrate that museum specimens can be used in anchored hybrid enrichment studies.

	abstract = {Recurrent rearrangements of Chromosome 8p23.1 are associated with congenital heart defects and developmental delay. The complexity of this region has led to inconsistencies in the current reference assembly, confounding studies of genetic variation. Using comparative sequence-based approaches, we generated a high-quality 6.3-Mbp alternate reference assem-bly of an inverted Chromosome 8p23.1 haplotype. Comparison with nonhuman primates reveals a 746-kbp duplicative transposition and two separate inversion events that arose in the last million years of human evolution. The breakpoints associated with these rearrangements map to an ape-specific interchromosomal core duplicon that clusters at sites of evo-lutionary inversion (P = 7.8 × 10 −5). Refinement of microdeletion breakpoints identifies a subgroup of patients that map to the same interchromosomal core involved in the evolutionary formation of the duplication blocks. Our results define a higher-order genomic instability element that has shaped the structure of specific chromosomes during primate evolution contributing to rearrangements associated with inversion and disease. [Supplemental material is available for this article.] The Chromosome 8p23.1 region is one of the most structurally dy-namic regions of the human genome associated with both normal and disease-causing variation. It contains a common, 4.2-Mbp polymorphic inversion that is highly stratified among human populations (Antonacci et al. 2009; Salm et al. 2012). The allele frequency of the inversion ranges from 60\% in Africans to as low as 20\% in Asian populations. Recurrent microdeletions between large blocks of segmental duplications (SDs) are associated with congenital heart defects, microcephaly, and developmental delay (Devriendt et al. 1999). Reciprocal duplications and smaller atypical deletions have also been described in individuals that present with a wide range of phenotypic features, including devel-opmental delay, mild dysmorphism, and congenital anomalies (Devriendt et al. 1999; Barber et al. 2007). The breakpoints associ-ated with these rearrangements, including the inversion polymor-phism, map to large, complex blocks of high-identity SDs located at either end of the critical region. It has been proposed that het-erozygous carriers of the inverted haplotype are particularly predis-posed to unequal crossover resulting in recurrent rearrangements at Chromosome 8p23.1 and susceptibility to disease (Giglio et al. 2001; Giorda et al. 2007). Structural variants, including copy number polymorphic loci, map to SDs that contain a cluster of six beta-defensin genes and the defensin-related gene, sperm associated antigen 11B (Giglio et al. 2001; Hollox et al. 2003). The beta defensins vary substan-tially in copy number, and this common variation has been asso-ciated with multiple immune-related phenotypes, including psoriasis and Crohn's disease (Cantsilieris and White 2013). Despite the importance of the Chromosome 8p23.1 locus in hu-man health and disease, the existence of large alternative struc-tural haplotypes, combined with a complex organization of SDs, has led to inconsistencies in the current human reference assem-bly that have not yet been resolved (Bakar et al. 2009). Moreover, such genomic complexity represents a significant challenge that has impeded studies of genetic association, including susceptibil-ity to disease (Hollox 2012). In this study, we sought to understand the contemporary and evolutionary structural instability associated with this locus, first by constructing a high-quality alternate reference sequence of the inverted 8p23.1 haplotype (6.3 Mbp) through SMRT (single-molecule, real-time) sequencing and de novo assembly of},

However, cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies arise in approximately 20\% of HIV-1-infected individuals, and details of their generation could provide a blueprint for effective vaccination. Here we report the isolation, evolution and structure of a broadly neutralizing antibody from an African donor followed from the time of infection. The mature antibody, CH103, neutralized approximately 55\% of HIV-1 isolates, and its co-crystal structure with the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 revealed a new loop-based mechanism of CD4-binding-site recognition. Virus and antibody gene sequencing revealed concomitant virus evolution and antibody maturation. Notably, the unmutated common ancestor of the CH103 lineage avidly bound the transmitted/founder HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, and evolution of antibody neutralization breadth was preceded by extensive viral diversification in and near the CH103 epitope. These data determine the viral and antibody evolution leading to induction of a lineage of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies, and provide insights into strategies to elicit similar antibodies by vaccination.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinically, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) pol sequences are used to evaluate for drug resistance. These data can also be used to evaluate transmission networks and help describe factors associated with transmission risk.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: HIV-1 pol sequences from participants at 5 sites in the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) cohort from 2000-2009 were analyzed for genetic relatedness. Only the first available sequence per participant was included. Inferred transmission networks ("clusters") were defined as ≥2 sequences with ≤1.5\% genetic distance. Clusters including ≥3 patients ("networks") were evaluated for clinical and demographic associations.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Of 3697 sequences, 24\% fell into inferred clusters: 155 clusters of 2 individuals ("dyads"), 54 clusters that included 3-14 individuals ("networks"), and 1 large cluster that included 336 individuals across all study sites. In multivariable analyses, factors associated with being in a cluster included not using antiretroviral (ARV) drugs at time of sampling (P {\textless} .001), sequence collected after 2004 (P {\textless} .001), CD4 cell count {\textgreater}350 cells/mL (P {\textless} .01), and viral load 10,000-100,000 copies/mL (P {\textless} .001) or {\textgreater}100,000 copies/mL (P {\textless} .001). In networks, women were more likely to cluster with other women (P {\textless} .001), and African Americans with other African Americans (P {\textless} .001).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Molecular epidemiology can be applied to study HIV transmission networks in geographically and demographically diverse cohorts. Clustering was associated with lack of ARV use and higher viral load, implying transmission may be interrupted by earlier diagnosis and treatment. Observed female and African American networks reinforce the importance of diagnosis and prevention efforts targeted by sex and race.},

It was possible to amplify and sequence mitochondrial control region DNA extracted from seven of the 11 samples, including two Pleistocene B. primigenius samples. We compared the results with published data by constructing phylogenetic networks. The two B. primigenius samples clustered with the extant B. taurus samples in the networks. The similarity between B. primigenius and modern taurine cattle confirms that these should be considered members of a single species. The sequences obtained from the B. taurus specimens were either identical to the reference sequence for modern European cattle or closely related to it. They included two sequences not previously documented. The network analysis of the ancient data highlights the intermediary nature of the B. primigenius sequences between modern European and African B. taurus and the proximity of the ancient DNA B. taurus sequences to modern European B. taurus. Further analysis of the extant data in the light of the ancient DNA results suggests that a degree of Pleistocene diversity survives in the extant European Bos population that is mainly derived from a more recent population expansion.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Distance-based phylogeny inference methods first estimate evolutionary distances between every pair of taxa, then build a tree from the so-obtained distance matrix. These methods are fast and fairly accurate. However, they hardly deal with incomplete distance matrices. Such matrices are frequent with recent multi-gene studies, when two species do not share any gene in analyzed data. The few existing algorithms to infer trees with satisfying accuracy from incomplete distance matrices have time complexity in O(n4) or more, where n is the number of taxa, which precludes large scale studies. Agglomerative distance algorithms (e.g. NJ 12) are much faster, with time complexity in O(n3) which allows huge datasets and heavy bootstrap analyses to be dealt with. These algorithms proceed in three steps: (a) search for the taxon pair to be agglomerated, (b) estimate the lengths of the two so-created branches, (c) reduce the distance matrix and return to (a) until the tree is fully resolved. But available agglomerative algorithms cannot deal with incomplete matrices. RESULTS We propose an adaptation to incomplete matrices of three agglomerative algorithms, namely NJ, BIONJ 3 and MVR 4. Our adaptation generalizes to incomplete matrices the taxon pair selection criterion of NJ (also used by BIONJ and MVR), and combines this generalized criterion with that of ADDTREE 5. Steps (b) and (c) are also modified, but O(n3) time complexity is kept. The performance of these new algorithms is studied with large scale simulations, which mimic multi-gene phylogenomic datasets. Our new algorithms - named NJ*, BIONJ* and MVR* - infer phylogenetic trees that are as least as accurate as those inferred by other available methods, but with much faster running times. MVR* presents the best overall performance. This algorithm accounts for the variance of the pairwise evolutionary distance estimates, and is well suited for multi-gene studies where some distances are accurately estimated using numerous genes, whereas others are poorly estimated (or not estimated) due to the low number (absence) of sequenced genes being shared by both species. CONCLUSION Our distance-based agglomerative algorithms NJ*, BIONJ* and MVR* are fast and accurate, and should be quite useful for large scale phylogenomic studies. When combined with the SDM method 6 to estimate a distance matrix from multiple genes, they offer a relevant alternative to usual supertree techniques 7. Binaries and all simulated data are downloadable from 8.},

	abstract = {Detection of recent natural selection is a challenging problem in population genetics, as standard methods generally integrate over long timescales. Here we introduce the Singleton Density Score (SDS), a powerful measure to infer very recent changes in allele frequencies from contemporary genome sequences. When applied to data from the UK10K Project, SDS reflects allele frequency changes in the ancestors of modern Britons during the past 2,000 years. We see strong signals of selection at lactase and HLA, and in favor of blond hair and blue eyes. Turning to signals of polygenic adaptation we find, remarkably, that recent selection for increased height has driven allele frequency shifts across most of the genome. Moreover, we report suggestive new evidence for polygenic shifts affecting many other complex traits. Our results suggest that polygenic adaptation has played a pervasive role in shaping genotypic and phenotypic variation in modern humans.},

Yet, in these fields this technique has an important limitation: phylogenetic non-independence exists among taxa, violating the statistical assumptions underlying traditional meta-analytic models. Recently, meta-analytical techniques incorporating phylogenetic information have been developed to address this issue. However, no syntheses have evaluated how often including phylogenetic information changes meta-analytic results. To address this gap, we built phylogenies for and re-analysed 30 published meta-analyses, comparing results for traditional vs. phylogenetic approaches and assessing which characteristics of phylogenies best explained changes in meta-analytic results and relative model fit. Accounting for phylogeny significantly changed estimates of the overall pooled effect size in 47\{\%\} of datasets for fixed-effects analyses and 7\{\%\} of datasets for random-effects analyses. Accounting for phylogeny also changed whether those effect sizes were significantly different from zero in 23 and 40\{\%\} of our datasets (for fixed- and random-effects models, respectively). Across datasets, decreases in pooled effect size magnitudes after incorporating phylogenetic information were associated with larger phylogenies and those with stronger phylogenetic signal. We conclude that incorporating phylogenetic information in ecological meta-analyses is important, and we provide practical recommendations for doing so.},

	abstract = {Despite the rapid increase of size in phylogenomic data sets, a number of important nodes on animal phylogeny are still unresolved. Among these, the rooting of the placental mammal tree is still a controversial issue. One difficulty lies in the pervasive phylogenetic conflicts among genes, with each one telling its own story, which may be reliable or not. Here, we identified a simple criterion, that is, the GC content, which substantially helps in determining which gene trees best reflect the species tree. We assessed the ability of 13,111 coding sequence alignments to correctly reconstruct the placental phylogeny. We found that GC-rich genes induced a higher amount of conflict among gene trees and performed worse than AT-rich genes in retrieving well-supported, consensual nodes on the placental tree. We interpret this GC effect mainly as a consequence of genome-wide variations in recombination rate. Indeed, recombination is known to drive GC-content evolution through GC-biased gene conversion and might be problematic for phylogenetic reconstruction, for instance, in an incomplete lineage sorting context. When we focused on the AT-richest fraction of the data set, the resolution level of the placental phylogeny was greatly increased, and a strong support was obtained in favor of an Afrotheria rooting, that is, Afrotheria as the sister group of all other placentals. We show that in mammals most conflicts among gene trees, which have so far hampered the resolution of the placental tree, are concentrated in the GC-rich regions of the genome. We argue that the GC content-because it is a reliable indicator of the long-term recombination rate-is an informative criterion that could help in identifying the most reliable molecular markers for species tree inference.},

These analyses identified position HXB2 5905 within the cysteine-rich domain of tat as a signature of CSF-derived HIV-1, and a higher number of mixed bases in CSF, as measure of diversity, was associated with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. Since identified mutations were synonymous, we evaluated the predicted secondary RNA structures, which showed that this mutation altered secondary structure. As a measure of divergence, the genetic distance between the blood and CSF-derived tat was inversely correlated with current and nadir CD4+ T cell counts.

We show that this approach to ML supertree reconstruction is statistically consistent (it converges on the true species supertree as more input trees are combined), in contrast to the widely used MRP method, which we show can be statistically inconsistent under the exponential error model. We also show that this statistical consistency extends to an ML approach for constructing species supertrees from gene trees. In this setting, incomplete lineage sorting (due to coalescence rates of homologous genes being lower than speciation rates) has been shown to lead to gene trees that are frequently different from species trees, and this can confound efforts to reconstruct the species phylogeny correctly.},

Episodic bursts of positive selection were detected in several viral proteins, including regions associated with host cell interaction and viral replication. Host shifts involved unique sets of substitutions, and few sites exhibited repeated evolution across adaptation to many bat species, suggesting diverse genetic determinants over host range. Combining these results with genetic reconstructions of the demographic histories of individual viral lineages revealed that although rabies viruses shared consistent three-stage processes of emergence in each new bat species, host shifts involving greater numbers of positively selected substitutions had longer delays between cross-species transmission and enzootic viral establishment. Our results point to multiple evolutionary routes to host establishment in a zoonotic RNA virus that may influence the speed of viral emergence.},

Therefore, we develop new methods to analyze uncertainty about the parameters of a model, the lag specification, the serial correlation of shocks, and the effects of real time data in one coherent structure. We consider both parametric and nonparametric specifications of this structure and use them to estimate the uncertainty in a small model of the US economy. We then use our estimates to compute robust Bayesian and minimax monetary policy rules, which are designed to perform well in the face of uncertainty. Our results suggest that the aggressiveness recently found in robust policy rules is likely to be caused by overemphasizing uncertainty about economic dynamics at low frequencies.},

The use of larger gene sets that consist in addition of non-orthologous genes (e.g. so-called paralogous or xenologous genes) considerably increases the information about the evolutionary history of the respective species.

	abstract = {Although the use of phylogenetic trees in epidemiological investigations has become commonplace, their epidemiological interpretation has not been systematically evaluated. Here, we use an HIV-1 within-host coalescent model to probabilistically evaluate transmission histories of two epidemiologically linked hosts. Previous critique of phylogenetic reconstruction has claimed that direction of transmission is difficult to infer, and that the existence of unsampled intermediary links or common sources can never be excluded. The phylogenetic relationship between the HIV populations of epidemiologically linked hosts can be classified into six types of trees, based on cladistic relationships and whether the reconstruction is consistent with the true transmission history or not. We show that the direction of transmission and whether unsampled intermediary links or common sources existed make very different predictions about expected phylogenetic relationships: (i) Direction of transmission can often be established when paraphyly exists, (ii) intermediary links can be excluded when multiple lineages were transmitted, and (iii) when the sampled individuals' HIV populations both are monophyletic a common source was likely the origin. Inconsistent results, suggesting the wrong transmission direction, were generally rare. In addition, the expected tree topology also depends on the number of transmitted lineages, the sample size, the time of the sample relative to transmission, and how fast the diversity increases after infection. Typically, 20 or more sequences per subject give robust results. We confirm our theoretical evaluations with analyses of real transmission histories and discuss how our findings should aid in interpreting phylogenetic results.},

Representations of multiple trees (which may or may not have identical termini) can readily be combined into a single matrix; columns of discrete-character-state data can be added and, if desired, weighted differentially.

Simulations were used to test whether our analysis could distinguish between alternative Cambrian explosion scenarios with increasing levels of autocorrelated rate variation. Our analyses support previous phylogenomic hypotheses and simulations indicate a Precambrian origin of the arthropods. Our results provide insights into the 3 independent colonizations of land by arthropods and suggest that evolution of insect wings happened much earlier than the fossil record indicates, with flight evolving during a period of increasing oxygen levels and impressively large forests.

Here we demonstrate that rates of species diversification are highly correlated with the rate of body size evolution across the 30,000+ living species of ray-finned fishes that comprise the majority of vertebrate biological diversity. This coupling is a general feature of fish evolution and transcends vast differences in ecology and body-plan organization. Our results may reflect a widespread speciational mode of character change in living fishes. Alternatively, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that phenotypic 'evolvability'-the capacity of organisms to evolve-shapes the dynamics of speciation through time at the largest phylogenetic scales.},

We do not claim that one of these measures is better than the other, but they are definitely different. Such a situation can be the source of confusion when alignments obtained using various methods are compared. Therefore, we propose a new nomenclature for the measures of the quality of multiple sequence alignments to distinguish which one was actually calculated. Moreover, we have found that the occurrence of a gap in some column in the first sequence of the reference alignment causes column discarding.},

These algorithms are not appropriate when the polytomy is interpreted in the usual way, namely as representing uncertainty in the cladogram's resolution. New algorithms for both ordered and unordered characters are presented to reconstruct character evolution under the uncertain-resolution interpretation of polytomies. These algorithms allow the cladogram to resolve itself so as to be favourable for the character whose evolution is being reconstructed. Because different characters may have different favourable resolutions, it is not possible in general to use these algorithms to determine the total parsimony of a polytomous cladogram (the number of evolutionary steps required over all characters by the cladogram), for which the only adequate approach is to find a most parsimonious dichotomous resolution of the cladogram.},

The history of these events can be inferred via comparison of gene and species trees, a process called reconciliation, yet current reconciliation algorithms model only a subset of these evolutionary processes.

RESULTS: We present an algorithm to reconcile a binary gene tree with a nonbinary species tree under a DTLI parsimony criterion. This is the first reconciliation algorithm to capture all four evolutionary processes driving tree incongruence and the first to reconcile non-binary species trees with a transfer model. Our algorithm infers all optimal solutions and reports complete, temporally feasible event histories, giving the gene and species lineages in which each event occurred. It is fixed-parameter tractable, with polytime complexity when the maximum species outdegree is fixed. Application of our algorithms to prokaryotic and eukaryotic data show that use of an incomplete event model has substantial impact on the events inferred and resulting biological conclusions.

AVAILABILITY: Our algorithms have been implemented in Notung, a freely available phylogenetic reconciliation software package, available at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/{\textasciitilde}durand/Notung.

A C-terminal fragment of the mitochondrial gene for cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) has been proposed as universal marker for this purpose among animals. Results: Herein we present experimental evidence that the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene fulfills the requirements for a universal DNA barcoding marker in amphibians. In terms of universality of priming sites and identification of major vertebrate clades the studied 16S fragment is superior to COI. Amplification success was 100\% for 16S in a subset of fresh and well-preserved samples of Madagascan frogs, while various combination of COI primers had lower success rates.COI priming sites showed high variability among amphibians both at the level of groups and closely related species, whereas 16S priming sites were highly conserved among vertebrates. Interspecific pairwise 16S divergences in a test group of Madagascan frogs were at a level suitable for assignment of larval stages to species (1–17\%), with low degrees of pairwise haplotype divergence within populations (0–1\%). Conclusion: We strongly advocate the use of 16S rRNA as standard DNA barcoding marker for vertebrates to complement COI, especially if samples a priori could belong to various phylogenetically distant taxa and false negatives would constitute a major problem.},

Neighbor Joining (NJ) is a so-called distance-based method that, thanks to its good accuracy and speed, has been embraced by the phylogeny community. It takes the distances between n taxa and produces in Θ (n3) time a phylogenetic tree, i.e., a tree which aims to describe the evolutionary history of the taxa. In addition to performing well in practice, the NJ algorithm has optimal reconstruction radius. The contribution of this paper is twofold: (1) we present an algorithm called Fast Neighbor Joining (FNJ) with optimal reconstruction radius and optimal run time complexity O (n2) and (2) we present a greatly simplified proof for the correctness of NJ. Initial experiments show that FNJ in practice has almost the same accuracy as NJ, indicating that the property of optimal reconstruction radius has great importance to their good performance. Moreover, we show how improved running time can be achieved for computing the so-called correction formulas. © 2009.},

A philosophy is presented for model-based data analysis and a general strategy outlined for the analysis of empirical data. The book invites increased attention on a priori science hypotheses and modeling.Kullback-Leibler Information represents a fundamental quantity in science and is Hirotugu Akaike's basis for model selection. The maximized log-likelihood function can be bias-corrected as an estimator of expected, relative Kullback-Leibler information. This leads to Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and various extensions. These methods are relatively simple and easy to use in practice, but based on deep statistical theory. The information theoretic approaches provide a unified and rigorous theory, an extension of likelihood theory, an important application of information theory, and are objective and practical to employ across a very wide class of empirical problems.The book presents several new ways to incorporate model selection uncertainty into parameter estimates and estimates of precision. An array of challenging examples is given to illustrate various technical issues.This is an applied book written primarily for biologists and statisticians wanting to make inferences from multiple models and is suitable as a graduate text or as a reference for professional analysts.},

Phylogenomics -- the study of evolutionary relationships based on comparative analysis of genome-scale data -- has so far been developed as industrial-scale molecular phylogenetics, proceeding in the two classical steps: multiple alignment of homologous sequences, followed by inference of a tree (or multiple trees). However, the algorithms typically employed for these steps scale poorly with number of sequences, such that for an increasing number of problems, high-quality phylogenomic analysis is (or soon will be) computationally infeasible. Moreover, next-generation data are often incomplete and error-prone, and analysis may be further complicated by genome rearrangement, gene fusion and deletion, lateral genetic transfer, and transcript variation. Here we argue that next-generation data require next-generation phylogenomics, including so-called alignment-free approaches.Reviewers: Reviewed by Mr Alexander Panchin (nominated by Dr Mikhail Gelfand), Dr Eugene Koonin and Prof Peter Gogarten.

Using spectratype analysis, we have previously shown that the B-cell repertoire of older people shows evidence of inappropriate clonal expansions in the absence of challenge, and that this loss of B-cell diversity correlates with poor health. Studies on response to vaccination, using both spectratyping and high-throughput sequencing of the repertoire, indicate that older responses to challenge are lacking in magnitude and/or delayed significantly. Also that some of the biologically significant differences may be in different classes of antibody. We have also previously shown that normal young B-cell repertoires can vary between different phenotypic subsets of B cells. In this paper, we present an analysis of immunoglobulin repertoire in different subclasses of antibody in five different populations of B cell, and show how the repertoire in these different groups changes with age. Although some age-related repertoire differences occur in naive cells, before exogenous antigen exposure, we see indications that there is a general dysregulation of the selective forces that shape memory B-cell populations in older people.},

	abstract = {Environmental drivers of biodiversity can be identified by relating patterns of community similarity to ecological factors. Community variation has traditionally been assessed by considering changes in species composition and more recently by incorporating phylogenetic information to account for the relative similarity of taxa. Here, we describe how an important class of measures including Bray-Curtis, Canberra, and UniFrac can be extended to allow community variation to be computed on a phylogenetic network. We focus on phylogenetic split systems, networks that are produced by the widely used median network and neighbor-net methods, which can represent incongruence in the evolutionary history of a set of taxa. Calculating β diversity over a split system provides a measure of community similarity averaged over uncertainty or conflict in the available phylogenetic signal. Our freely available software, Network Diversity, provides 11 qualitative (presence-absence, unweighted) and 14 quantitative (weighted) network-based measures of community similarity that model different aspects of community richness and evenness. We demonstrate the broad applicability of network-based diversity approaches by applying them to three distinct data sets: pneumococcal isolates from distinct geographic regions, human mitochondrial DNA data from the Indonesian island of Nias, and proteorhodopsin sequences from the Sargasso and Mediterranean Seas. Our results show that major expected patterns of variation for these data sets are recovered using network-based measures, which indicates that these patterns are robust to phylogenetic uncertainty and conflict. Nonetheless, network-based measures of community similarity can differ substantially from measures ignoring phylogenetic relationships or from tree-based measures when incongruent signals are present in the underlying data. Network-based measures provide a methodology for assessing the robustness of β-diversity results in light of incongruent phylogenetic signal and allow β diversity to be calculated over widely used network structures such as median networks.},

Yet, for large data sets and realistic or interesting models of evolution, these approaches remain computationally demanding. High-throughput sequencing can yield data for thousands of taxa, but scaling to such problems using serial computing often necessitates the use of nonstatistical or approximate approaches. The recent emergence of graphics processing units (GPUs) provides an opportunity to leverage their excellent floating-point computational performance to accelerate statistical phylogenetic inference. A specialized library for phylogenetic calculation would allow existing software packages to make more effective use of available computer hardware, including GPUs. Adoption of a common library would also make it easier for other emerging computing architectures, such as field programmable gate arrays, to be used in the future. We present BEAGLE, an application programming interface (API) and library for high-performance statistical phylogenetic inference. The API provides a uniform interface for performing phylogenetic likelihood calculations on a variety of compute hardware platforms. The library includes a set of efficient implementations and can currently exploit hardware including GPUs using NVIDIA CUDA, central processing units (CPUs) with Streaming SIMD Extensions and related processor supplementary instruction sets, and multicore CPUs via OpenMP. To demonstrate the advantages of a common API, we have incorporated the library into several popular phylogenetic software packages.

cephalochordates (lancelets) and vertebrates (including lamprey and
hagfish) constitute the three extant groups of chordate animals.
Traditionally, cephalochordates are considered as the closest living
relatives of vertebrates, with tunicates representing the earliest
chordate lineage. This view is mainly justified by overall morphological
similarities and an apparently increased complexity in cephalochordates
and vertebrates relative to tunicates. Despite their critical importance
for understanding the origins of vertebrates, phylogenetic studies
of chordate relationships have provided equivocal results. Taking
advantage of the genome sequencing of the appendicularian Oikopleura
dioica, we assembled a phylogenomic data set of 146 nuclear genes
(33,800 unambiguously aligned amino acids) from 14 deuterostomes
and 24 other slowly evolving species as an outgroup. Here we show
that phylogenetic analyses of this data set provide compelling evidence
that tunicates, and not cephalochordates, represent the closest living
relatives of vertebrates. Chordate monophyly remains uncertain because
cephalochordates, albeit with a non-significant statistical support,
surprisingly grouped with echinoderms, a hypothesis that needs to
be tested with additional data. This new phylogenetic scheme prompts
a reappraisal of both morphological and palaeontological data and
has important implications for the interpretation of developmental
and genomic studies in which tunicates and cephalochordates are used
as model animals.},

For the first time we characterize the genome and measure rates of genome evolution in House Finch isolates of MG, as well as in poultry outgroups. Using whole-genome sequences of 12 House Finch isolates across a 13-year serial sample and an additional four newly sequenced poultry strains, we estimate a nucleotide diversity in House Finch isolates of only ∼2\% of ancestral poultry strains and a nucleotide substitution rate of 0.8-1.2×10(-5) per site per year both in poultry and in House Finches, an exceptionally fast rate rivaling some of the highest estimates reported thus far for bacteria. We also found high diversity and complete turnover of CRISPR arrays in poultry MG strains prior to the switch to the House Finch host, but after the invasion of House Finches there is progressive loss of CRISPR repeat diversity, and recruitment of novel CRISPR repeats ceases. Recent (2007) House Finch MG strains retain only ∼50\% of the CRISPR repertoire founding (1994-95) strains and have lost the CRISPR-associated genes required for CRISPR function. Our results suggest that genome evolution in bacterial pathogens of wild birds can be extremely rapid and in this case is accompanied by apparent functional loss of CRISPRs.},

Much about the epidemiology of a disease can be learned when these individual transmission events are known or can be estimated. Such estimations are difficult and generally feasible only when detailed epidemiological data are available. The genealogy estimated from genetic sequences of sampled pathogens is another rich source of information on transmission history. Optimal inference of transmission events calls for the combination of genetic data and epidemiological data into one joint analysis. A key difficulty is that the transmission tree, which describes the transmission events between infected hosts, differs from the phylogenetic tree, which describes the ancestral relationships between pathogens sampled from these hosts. The trees differ both in timing of the internal nodes and in topology. These differences become more pronounced when a higher fraction of infected hosts is sampled. We show how the phylogenetic tree of sampled pathogens is related to the transmission tree of an outbreak of an infectious disease, by the within-host dynamics of pathogens. We provide a statistical framework to infer key epidemiological and mutational parameters by simultaneously estimating the phylogenetic tree and the transmission tree. We test the approach using simulations and illustrate its use on an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. The approach unifies existing methods in the emerging field of phylodynamics with transmission tree reconstruction methods that are used in infectious disease epidemiology.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic tests of topology offer a powerful means of evaluating competing phylogenetic hypotheses. The performance of the nonparametric Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test, the parametric Swofford-Olsen-Waddell-Hillis (SOWH) test, and Bayesian posterior probabilities were explored for five data sets for which all the phylogenetic relationships are known with a very high degree of certainty. These results are consistent with previous simulation studies that have indicated a tendency for the SOWH test to be prone to generating Type 1 errors because of model misspecification coupled with branch length heterogeneity. These results also suggest that the SOWH test may accord overconfidence in the true topology when the null hypothesis is in fact correct. In contrast, the SH test was observed to be much more conservative, even under high substitution rates and branch length heterogeneity. For some of those data sets where the SOWH test proved misleading, the Bayesian posterior probabilities were also misleading. The results of all tests were strongly influenced by the exact substitution model assumptions. Simple models, especially those that assume rate homogeneity among sites, had a higher Type 1 error rate and were more likely to generate misleading posterior probabilities. For some of these data sets, the commonly used substitution models appear to be inadequate for estimating appropriate levels of uncertainty with the SOWH test and Bayesian methods. Reasons for the differences in statistical power between the two maximum likelihood tests are discussed and are contrasted with the Bayesian approach.},

We therefore used a population based province wide HIV drug resistance database in British Columbia (BC), Canada, to evaluate the impact of clinical, demographic, and behavioral factors on rates of HIV transmission. METHODS: We reconstructed molecular phylogenies from 27,296 anonymized bulk HIV pol sequences representing 7747 individuals in BC-about half the estimated HIV prevalence in BC. Infections were grouped into clusters based on phylogenetic distances, as a proxy for variation in transmission rates. Rates of cluster expansion were reconstructed from estimated dates of HIV seroconversion. RESULTS: Our criteria grouped 4431 individuals into 744 clusters largely separated with respect to risk factors, including large established clusters predominated by injection drug users and more-recently emerging clusters comprising men who have sex with men. The mean log10 viral load of an individual's phylogenetic neighborhood (composed of 5 other individuals with shortest phylogenetic distances) increased their odds of appearing in a cluster by {\textgreater}2-fold per log10 viruses per milliliter. CONCLUSIONS: Hotspots of ongoing HIV transmission can be characterized in near real time by the secondary analysis of HIV resistance genotypes, providing an important potential resource for targeting public health initiatives for HIV prevention.},

	abstract = {Accurate gene tree-species tree reconciliation is fundamental to inferring the evolutionary history of a gene family. However, although it has long been appreciated that population-related effects such as incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) can dramatically affect the gene tree, many of the most popular reconciliation methods consider discordance only due to gene duplication and loss (and sometimes horizontal gene transfer). Methods that do model ILS are either highly parameterized or consider a restricted set of histories, thus limiting their applicability and accuracy. To address these challenges, we present a novel algorithm DLCpar for inferring a most parsimonious (MP) history of a gene family in the presence of duplications, losses, and ILS. Our algorithm relies on a new reconciliation structure, the labeled coalescent tree (LCT), that simultaneously describes coalescent and duplication-loss history. We show that the LCT representation enables an exhaustive and efficient search over the space of reconciliations, and, for most gene families, the least common ancestor (LCA) mapping is an optimal solution for the species mapping between the gene tree and species tree in a MP LCT. Applying our algorithm to a variety of clades, including flies, fungi, and primates, as well as to simulated phylogenies, we achieve high accuracy, comparable to sophisticated probabilistic reconciliation methods, at reduced runtime and with far fewer parameters. These properties enable inference of complex evolution of gene families across a broad range of species and large data sets.},

Unambiguous resolution of the relationships among these lineages remains elusive, with previous molecular and morphological analyses failing to produce a consensus phylogeny. In this study, we use over 350 ultraconserved element (UCEs) loci comprising five million base pairs collected across thirty-five representative ostariophysan species to compile one of the most data-rich phylogenies of fishes to date. We use these data to infer higher-level (interordinal) relationships among ostariophysan fishes, focusing on the monophyly of the Characiformes— one the most contentiously debated groups in fish systematics. As with most previous molecular studies, we recover a non-monophyletic Characiformes with the two monophyletic suborders, Citharinoidei and Characoidei, more closely related to other ostariophysan clades than to each other. We also explore incongruence between results from different UCE datasets, issues of orthology, and the use of morphological characters in combination with our molecular data. Keywords:},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Understanding fern (monilophyte) phylogeny and its evolutionary timescale is critical for broad investigations of the evolution of land plants, and for providing the point of comparison necessary for studying the evolution of the fern sister group, seed plants. Molecular phylogenetic investigations have revolutionized our understanding of fern phylogeny, however, to date, these studies have relied almost exclusively on plastid data. METHODS: Here we take a curated phylogenomics approach to infer the first broad fern phylogeny from multiple nuclear loci, by combining broad taxon sampling (73 ferns and 12 outgroup species) with focused character sampling (25 loci comprising 35877 bp), along with rigorous alignment, orthology inference and model selection. KEY RESULTS: Our phylogeny corroborates some earlier inferences and provides novel insights; in particular, we find strong support for Equisetales as sister to the rest of ferns, Marattiales as sister to leptosporangiate ferns, and Dennstaedtiaceae as sister to the eupolypods. Our divergence-time analyses reveal that divergences among the extant fern orders all occurred prior to [{\textasciitilde}]200 MYA. Finally, our species-tree inferences are congruent with analyses of concatenated data, but generally with lower support. Those cases where species-tree support values are higher than expected involve relationships that have been supported by smaller plastid datasets, suggesting that deep coalescence may be reducing support from the concatenated nuclear data. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the utility of a curated phylogenomics approach to inferring fern phylogeny, and highlights the need to consider underlying data characteristics, along with data quantity, in phylogenetic studies.},

Although the parsimony method often makes reasonable reconstructions of the history of a character, it has a number of limitations. These limitations include the inability to consider more than a single change along a branch on a tree and the uncoupling of evolutionary time from amount of character change.

Although species richness in groups like mammals, birds, or teleost fishes is often attributed to accelerated cladogenesis, we lack a quantitative conceptual framework for identifying and comparing the exceptional changes of tempo in vertebrate evolutionary history. We develop MEDUSA, a stepwise approach based upon the Akaike information criterion for detecting multiple shifts in birth and death rates on an incompletely resolved phylogeny. We apply MEDUSA incompletely to a diversity tree summarizing both evolutionary relationships and species richness of 44 major clades of jawed vertebrates. We identify 9 major changes in the tempo of gnathostome diversification; the most significant of these lies at the base of a clade that includes most of the coral-reef associated fishes as well as cichlids and perches. Rate increases also underlie several well recognized tetrapod radiations, including most modern birds, lizards and snakes, ostariophysan fishes, and most eutherian mammals. In addition, we find that large sections of the vertebrate tree exhibit nearly equal rates of origination and extinction, providing some of the first evidence from molecular data for the importance of faunal turnover in shaping biodiversity. Together, these results reveal living vertebrate biodiversity to be the product of volatile turnover punctuated by 6 accelerations responsible for {\textgreater}85\% of all species as well as 3 slowdowns that have produced "living fossils." In addition, by revealing the timing of the exceptional pulses of vertebrate diversification as well as the clades that experience them, our diversity tree provides a framework for evaluating particular causal hypotheses of vertebrate radiations.},

The accuracy of this approach, which promises to account for gene tree discordance, depends on the quality of the inferred gene trees. At the same time, phylogenomic and phylotranscriptomic analyses typically use involved bioinformatics pipelines for data preparation. Errors and shortcomings resulting from these preprocessing steps may impact the species tree analyses at the other end of the pipeline. In this article, we first show that the presence of fragmentary data for some species in a gene alignment, as often seen on real data, can result in substantial deterioration of gene trees, and as a result, the species tree. We then investigate a simple filtering strategy where individual fragmentary sequences are removed from individual genes but the rest of the gene is retained. Both in simulations and by reanalyzing a large insect phylotranscriptomic dataset, we show the effectiveness of this simple filtering strategy.},

	abstract = {The understanding that gene trees are often in discord with each other and with the species trees that contain them has led researchers to methods that incorporate the inherent stochasticity of genetic processes in the phylogenetic estimation procedure. Recently developed methods for species-tree estimation that not only consider the retention and sorting of ancestral polymorphism but also quantify the actual probabilities of incomplete lineage sorting are expected to provide an improvement over earlier summary-statistic based approaches that discard much of the information content of gene trees. However, these new methods have yet to be tested on truly challenging evolutionary histories such as those marked by recent rapid speciation where high levels of incomplete lineage sorting and discord among gene trees predominate. Here, we test a new maximum-likelihood method that incorporates stochastic models of both nucleotide substitution and lineage sorting for species-tree estimation. Using a simulation approach, we consider a broad range of species-tree topologies under 2 scenarios representing moderate and severe incomplete lineage sorting. We show that the maximum-likelihood method results in more accurate species trees than a summary-statistic based approach, demonstrating that information contained in discordant gene trees can be effectively extracted using a full probabilistic model. Moreover, we demonstrate that the shape of the original species tree (i.e., the relative lengths of internal branches) has a significant impact on whether the species tree is estimated accurately. In the speciation histories explored here, it is not just the recent origin of species that affects the accuracy of the estimates but the variance in relative species divergence times as well. Additionally, we show that sampling effort (number of individuals and/or loci) and sampling design (ratio of individuals to loci) are both important factors affecting the accuracy of species-tree estimates, which is again affected by the relative timing of divergence among species. The inherent difficulties of estimating relationships when species have undergone a recent radiation are discussed, and in particular, the limitations with maximum-likelihood estimates of species trees that do not consider uncertainty in the estimated gene trees of individual loci. Thus, despite substantial improvements over current summary-statistic based approaches, and the increased sophistication of procedures that incorporate the process of gene lineage coalescence, recent radiations still appear to pose daunting challenges for phylogenetics.},

	abstract = {Studies of insect assemblages are suited to the simultaneous DNA-based identification of multiple taxa known as metabarcoding. To obtain accurate estimates of diversity, metabarcoding markers ideally possess appropriate taxonomic coverage to avoid PCR-amplification bias, as well as sufficient sequence divergence to resolve species. We used in silico PCR to compare the taxonomic coverage and resolution of newly designed insect metabarcodes (targeting 16S) with that of existing markers [16S and cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (COI)] and then compared their efficiency in vitro. Existing metabarcoding primers amplified in silico {\textless}75\% of insect species with complete mitochondrial genomes available, whereas new primers targeting 16S provided {\textgreater}90\% coverage. Furthermore, metabarcodes targeting COI appeared to introduce taxonomic PCR-amplification bias, typically amplifying a greater percentage of Lepidoptera and Diptera species, while failing to amplify certain orders in silico. To test whether bias predicted in silico was observed in vitro, we created an artificial DNA blend containing equal amounts of DNA from 14 species, representing 11 insect orders and one arachnid. We PCR-amplified the blend using five primer sets, targeting either COI or 16S, with high-throughput amplicon sequencing yielding more than 6 million reads. In vitro results typically corresponded to in silico PCR predictions, with newly designed 16S primers detecting 11 insect taxa present, thus providing equivalent or better taxonomic coverage than COI metabarcodes. Our results demonstrate that in silico PCR is a useful tool for predicting taxonomic bias in mixed template PCR and that researchers should be wary of potential bias when selecting metabarcoding markers.},

To test that rapid microbial dispersal requires not only susceptible hosts but also a pre-existing, connecting network, we explored constructs meant to reveal the network properties associated with disease spread, which included the road structure.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: Using geo-temporal data collected from epizoonotics in which all hosts were susceptible (mammals infected by Foot-and-mouth disease virus, Uruguay, 2001; birds infected by Avian Influenza virus H5N1, Nigeria, 2006), two models were compared: 1) 'connectivity', a model that integrated bio-physical concepts (the agent's transmission cycle, road topology) into indicators designed to measure networks ('nodes' or infected sites with short- and long-range links), and 2) 'contacts', which focused on infected individuals but did not assess connectivity.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: THE CONNECTIVITY MODEL SHOWED FIVE NETWORK PROPERTIES: 1) spatial aggregation of cases (disease clusters), 2) links among similar 'nodes' (assortativity), 3) simultaneous activation of similar nodes (synchronicity), 4) disease flows moving from highly to poorly connected nodes (directionality), and 5) a few nodes accounting for most cases (a "20:80" pattern). In both epizoonotics, 1) not all primary cases were connected but at least one primary case was connected, 2) highly connected, small areas (nodes) accounted for most cases, 3) several classes of nodes were distinguished, and 4) the contact model, which assumed all primary cases were identical, captured half the number of cases identified by the connectivity model. When assessed together, the synchronicity and directionality properties explained when and where an infectious disease spreads.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Geo-temporal constructs of Network Theory's nodes and links were retrospectively validated in rapidly disseminating infectious diseases. They distinguished classes of cases, nodes, and networks, generating information usable to revise theory and optimize control measures. Prospective studies that consider pre-outbreak predictors, such as connecting networks, are recommended.},

	abstract = {Pathogen phylogenies are often used to infer spread among hosts. There is, however, not an exact match between the pathogen phylogeny and the host transmission history. Here, we examine in detail the limitations of this relationship. First, all splits in a pathogen phylogeny of more than 1 host occur within hosts, not at the moment of transmission, predating the transmission events as described by the pretransmission interval. Second, the order in which nodes in a phylogeny occur may be reflective of the within-host dynamics rather than epidemiologic relationships. To investigate these phenomena, motivated by within-host diversity patterns, we developed a two-phase coalescent model that includes a transmission bottleneck followed by linear outgrowth to a maximum population size followed by either stabilization or decline of the population. The model predicts that the pretransmission interval shrinks compared with predictions based on constant population size or a simple transmission bottleneck. Because lineages coalesce faster in a small population, the probability of a pathogen phylogeny to resemble the transmission history depends on when after infection a donor transmits to a new host. We also show that the probability of inferring the incorrect order of multiple transmissions from the same host is high. Finally, we compare time of HIV-1 infection informed by genetic distances in phylogenies to independent biomarker data, and show that, indeed, the pretransmission interval biases phylogeny-based estimates of when transmissions occurred. We describe situations where caution is needed not to misinterpret which parts of a phylogeny that may indicate outbreaks and tight transmission clusters.},

To address this shortcoming, we developed Clonify, which is able to perform unseeded lineage assignment on very large sets of antibody sequences. Application of Clonify to IgG+ memory repertoires from healthy individuals revealed a surprising lack of influence of large extended lineages on the overall repertoire composition, indicating that this composition is driven less by the order and frequency of pathogen encounters than previously thought.

This problem arises in evaluationary tree construction, where different methods or data yield (possibly) different trees for the same species on which the trees agree. A superpolynomial time algorithm for finding a maximum agreement subtree of two binary trees was found by Kubicka et al. In this paper, we will present an O(n4.5 log n + V) algorithm to determine the largest agreement subtree of two trees on n leaves, where V is the maximum number of nodes in the trees. For the case of trees of maximum degree k, there are two algorithms presented: one has running time O(k!n2 + V) while the other has running time O(k2.5n2 log n + V). These algorithms also apply when the trees are constrained to be rooted; in this case a maximum agreement subtree is also constrained to be rooted. Each of the algorithms we present can be modified to produce a maximum agreement subtree, rather than computing only the size. Thus, we can solve the searchproblem in the same running time as above.},

Background: Determining the evolutionary relationships among the major lineages of extant birds has been one of the biggest challenges in systematic biology. To address this challenge, we assembled or collected the genomes of 48 avian species spanning most orders of birds, including all Neognathae and two of the five Palaeognathae orders. We used these genomes to construct a genome-scale avian phylogenetic tree and perform comparative genomic analyses.Findings: Here we present the datasets associated with the phylogenomic analyses, which include sequence alignment files consisting of nucleotides, amino acids, indels, and transposable elements, as well as tree files containing gene trees and species trees. Inferring an accurate phylogeny required generating: 1) A well annotated data set across species based on genome synteny; 2) Alignments with unaligned or incorrectly overaligned sequences filtered out; and 3) Diverse data sets, including genes and their inferred trees, indels, and transposable elements. Our total evidence nucleotide tree (TENT) data set (consisting of exons, introns, and UCEs) gave what we consider our most reliable species tree when using the concatenation-based ExaML algorithm or when using statistical binning with the coalescence-based MP-EST algorithm (which we refer to as MP-EST*). Other data sets, such as the coding sequence of some exons, revealed other properties of genome evolution, namely convergence.Conclusions: The Avian Phylogenomics Project is the largest vertebrate phylogenomics project to date that we are aware of. The sequence, alignment, and tree data are expected to accelerate analyses in phylogenomics and other related areas.},

It was applied to maximum-likelihood tree selection for obtaining the confidence set of trees. The AU test is based on the theory of Efron et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:13429-13434; 1996), but the new method provides higher-order accuracy yet simpler implementation. The AU test, like the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test, adjusts the selection bias overlooked in the standard use of the bootstrap probability and Kishino-Hasegawa tests. The selection bias comes from comparing many trees at the same time and often leads to overconfidence in the wrong trees. The SH test, though safe to use, may exhibit another type of bias such that it appears conservative. Here I show that the AU test is less biased than other methods in typical cases of tree selection. These points are illustrated in a simulation study as well as in the analysis of mammalian mitochondrial protein sequences. The theoretical argument provides a simple formula that covers the bootstrap probability test, the Kishino-Hasegawa test, the AU test, and the Zharkikh-Li test. A practical suggestion is provided as to which test should be used under particular circumstances.},

Viral escape from CTL responses following superinfection was observed in two participants whose superinfecting strain completely replaced the initial strain. This pattern was not seen among participants whose superinfecting virus persisted in a recombinant form with the initial virus or was only detected transiently.

Using 16S information, PICRUSt recaptures key findings from the Human Microbiome Project and accurately predicts the abundance of gene families in host-associated and environmental communities, with quantifiable uncertainty.

While a greedy consensus algorithm, which consecutively accepts the most probable clades compatible with previously accepted clades, can be used for this second stage, this method is known to be statistically inconsistent under the multispecies coalescent model. This raises the question of whether it is theoretically possible to reconstruct the species tree from known probabilities of clades on gene trees.We investigate clade probabilities arising from the multispecies coalescent model, with an eye toward identifying features of the species tree. Clades on gene trees with probability greater than 1/3 are shown to reflect clades on the species tree, while those with smaller probabilities may not. Linear invariants of clade probabilities are studied both computationally and theoretically, with certain linear invariants giving insight into the clade structure of the species tree. For species trees with generic edge lengths, these invariants can be used to identify the species tree topology. These theoretical results both confirm that clade probabilities contain full information on the species tree topology and suggest future directions of study for developing statistically consistent inference methods from clade frequencies on gene trees. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Accuracy was measured by two measures of the distance between the true tree and the estimate of the tree, one measure sensitive to accuracy of branch lengths and the other not. The distance-matrix methods (Fitch-Margoliash and neighbor joining) performed best when they were constrained from estimating negative branch lengths; all comparisons with other methods used this constraint. Parsimony and compatibility had similar results, with compatibility generally inferior; Fitch-Margoliash and neighbor joining had similar results, with neighbor joining generally slightly inferior. Maximum likelihood was the most successful method overall, although for short sequences Fitch-Margoliash and neighbor joining were sometimes better. Bias of the estimates was inferred by measuring whether the independent estimates of a tree for different data sets were closer to the true tree than to each other. Parsimony and compatibility had particular difficulty with inaccuracy and bias when substitution rates varied among different branches. When rates of evolution varied among different sites, all methods showed signs of inaccuracy and bias.},

	volume = {1149312},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04300},
	abstract = {The reconstruction of a species phylogeny from genomic data faces two significant hurdles: 1) the trees describing the evolution of each individual gene--i.e., the gene trees--may differ from the species phylogeny and 2) the molecular sequences corresponding to each gene often provide limited information about the gene trees themselves. In this paper we consider an approach to species tree reconstruction that addresses both these hurdles. Specifically, we propose an algorithm for phylogeny reconstruction under the multispecies coalescent model with a standard model of site substitution. The multispecies coalescent is commonly used to model gene tree discordance due to incomplete lineage sorting, a well-studied population-genetic effect. In previous work, an information-theoretic trade-off was derived in this context between the number of loci, \$m\$, needed for an accurate reconstruction and the length of the locus sequences, \$k\$. It was shown that to reconstruct an internal branch of length \$f\$, one needs \$m\$ to be of the order of \$1/[f{\textasciicircum}\{2\} {\textbackslash}sqrt\{k\}]\$. That previous result was obtained under the molecular clock assumption, i.e., under the assumption that mutation rates (as well as population sizes) are constant across the species phylogeny. Here we generalize this result beyond the restrictive molecular clock assumption, and obtain a new reconstruction algorithm that has the same data requirement (up to log factors). Our main contribution is a novel reduction to the molecular clock case under the multispecies coalescent. As a corollary, we also obtain a new identifiability result of independent interest: for any species tree with \$n {\textbackslash}geq 3\$ species, the rooted species tree can be identified from the distribution of its unrooted weighted gene trees even in the absence of a molecular clock.},

	abstract = {We present the first molecular phylogenetic examination of the evolutionary position of retortamonads, a group of mitochondrion-lacking flagellates usually found as commensals of the intestinal tracts of vertebrates. Our phylogenies include small subunit ribosomal gene sequences from six retortamonad isolates—four from mammals and two from amphibians. All six sequences were highly similar (95\%–99\%), with those from mammals being almost identical to each other. All phylogenetic methods utilized unequivocally placed retortamonads with another amitochondriate group, the diplomonads. Surprisingly, all methods weakly supported a position for retortamonads cladistically within diplomonads, as the sister group to Giardia. This position would conflict with a single origin and uniform retention of the doubled-cell organization displayed by most diplomonads, but not by retortamonads. Diplomonad monophyly was not rejected by Shimodaira-Hasegawa, Kishino-Hasegawa, and expected likelihood weights methods but was marginally rejected by parametric bootstrapping. Analyses with additional phylogenetic markers are needed to test this controversial branching order within the retortamonad + diplomonad clade. Nevertheless, the robust phylogenetic association between diplomonads and retortamonads suggests that they share an amitochondriate ancestor. Because strong evidence indicates that diplomonads have secondarily lost their mitochondria (rather than being ancestrally amitochondriate), our results imply that retortamonads are also secondarily amitochondriate. Of the various groups of eukaryotes originally suggested to be primitively amitochondriate under the archezoa hypothesis, all have now been found to have physical or genetic mitochondrial relics (or both) or form a robust clade with an organism with such a relic.},

Here we have studied a unique HIV-1 transmission cluster consisting of nine infected individuals, for whom the time and direction of each virus transmission was exactly known. Most of the transmissions occurred between 1981 and 1983, and a total of 13 blood samples were obtained approximately 2-12 years later. The p17 gag and env V3 regions of the HIV-1 genome were directly sequenced from uncultured lymphocytes. A true phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the knowledge about when the transmissions had occurred and when the samples were obtained. This complex, known HIV-1 transmission history was compared with reconstructed molecular trees, which were calculated from the DNA sequences by several commonly used phylogenetic inference methods [Fitch-Margoliash, neighbor-joining, minimum-evolution, maximum-likelihood, maximum-parsimony, unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages (UPGMA), and a Fitch-Margoliash method assuming a molecular clock (KITSCH)]. A majority of the reconstructed trees were good estimates of the true phylogeny; 12 of 13 taxa were correctly positioned in the most accurate trees. The choice of gene fragment was found to be more important than the choice of phylogenetic method and substitution model. However, methods that are sensitive to unequal rates of change performed more poorly (such as UPGMA and KITSCH, which assume a constant molecular clock). The rapidly evolving V3 fragment gave better reconstructions than p17, but a combined data set of both p17 and V3 performed best. The accuracy of the phylogenetic methods justifies their use in HIV-1 research and argues against convergent evolution and selective transmission of certain virus variants.},

Mathematical theory about reconstructing species trees in the presence of HGT alone or ILS alone suggests that quartet-based species tree methods (known to be statistically consistent under ILS, or under bounded amounts of HGT) might be effective techniques for estimating species trees when both HGT and ILS are present.RESULTS:We evaluated several publicly available coalescent-based methods and concatenation under maximum likelihood on simulated datasets with moderate ILS and varying levels of HGT. Our study shows that two quartet-based species tree estimation methods (ASTRAL-2 and weighted Quartets MaxCut) are both highly accurate, even on datasets with high rates of HGT. In contrast, although NJst and concatenation using maximum likelihood are highly accurate under low HGT, they are less robust to high HGT rates.CONCLUSION:Our study shows that quartet-based species-tree estimation methods can be highly accurate under the presence of both HGT and ILS. The study suggests the possibility that some quartet-based methods might be statistically consistent under phylogenomic models of gene tree heterogeneity with both HGT and ILS.},

We show how each database supports a scale-free, topology with hierarchical modularity, indicating that these features represent a robust and generic property of the protein interactions network. We also find strong correlations between the network's structure and the functional role and subcellular localization of its protein constituents, concluding that most functional and/or localization classes appear as relatively segregated subnetworks of the full protein interaction network.

As sequencing costs continue to fall, an alternative approach based on genome-skimming has been proposed [1, 2]. This approach first applies low-pass (100 Mb – several Gb per sample) sequencing to voucher and/or query samples and then recovers marker genes and/or organelle genomes computationally. In contrast, we suggest the use of the unassembled sequence data for taxonomic identification using an alignment-free approach based on the k-mer decomposition of the sequencing reads. Specifically, we first estimate the average sequencing depth and error rate for each genome skim, by comparing our derived theoretical distribution of k-mers’ multiplicity and the histogram of k-mer counts computed using Jellyfish [3] . The genome length is also estimated from the average sequencing depth accordingly. Then, the similarity of two genome skims is measured by the Jaccard index between their corresponding k-mer collections. Finally, the hamming distance between genomes is estimated from the Jaccard index, using the following formula obtained by modeling the impact of low sequencing coverage, sequencing error, and differing genome lengths on the similarity of genome skims: D 1/k2(ζ1 L 1 + ζ 2 L 2 )J D = 1 ™. η 1 η 2 (L 1 + L 2 )(1 + J) In this equation, when coverage is low, we use all k-mers and set: η i = 1 ™ e ™ci(1™k/ℓ)(1™ɛi)k , ζ i = η i + c i (1 ™ k/ℓ)(1 ™ (1 ™ ɛ i ) k ). For higher coverages, we remove k-mers with multiplicity below a threshold m, and set: m™1 ∑ (c i (1 ™ k/ℓ)(1 ™ ɛ i ) k ) t ζ i = η i = 1 ™ e ™ci(1™k/ℓ)(1™ɛi)k . t! t=0 In these equations, k and ℓ are k-mer and read length, respectively, and c i , ɛ i , and L i are substituted from the estimates of coverage, error rate, and genome length for each genome skim. The Jaccard index between two genome skims, J, is computed by Mash [4] efficiently using a hashing technique. We have tested our tool, Skmer, on genome skims simulated from assemblies of 90 species from two genera of insects (Anopheles and Drosophila) and across the avian tree of life. We test the accuracy of the distances computed by Skmer, and subsequently use the distances to find the exact/closest match to a query sample in a reference set of genome skims. Comparing to the other k-mer based tools, Skmer shows excellent performance in our simulation studies, especially when the coverage is below 4X [5] . Skmer makes the assembly-free approach to genome-skimming a viable alternative to the traditional barcoding. The software is made publicly available on Github (https://github.com/shahab-sarmashghi/Skmer.git).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since its emergence in 1968, influenza A (H3N2) has evolved extensively in genotype and antigenic phenotype. However, despite strong pressure to evolve away from human immunity and to diversify in antigenic phenotype, H3N2 influenza shows paradoxically limited genetic and antigenic diversity present at any one time. Here, we propose a simple model of antigenic evolution in the influenza virus that accounts for this apparent discrepancy. RESULTS: In this model, antigenic phenotype is represented by a N-dimensional vector, and virus mutations perturb phenotype within this continuous Euclidean space. We implement this model in a large-scale individual-based simulation, and in doing so, we find a remarkable correspondence between model behavior and observed influenza dynamics. This model displays rapid evolution but low standing diversity and simultaneously accounts for the epidemiological, genetic, antigenic, and geographical patterns displayed by the virus. We find that evolution away from existing human immunity results in rapid population turnover in the influenza virus and that this population turnover occurs primarily along a single antigenic axis. CONCLUSIONS: Selective dynamics induce a canalized evolutionary trajectory, in which the evolutionary fate of the influenza population is surprisingly repeatable. In the model, the influenza population shows a 1- to 2-year timescale of repeatability, suggesting a window in which evolutionary dynamics could be, in theory, predictable.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: With the increasing availability of large protein-protein interaction networks, the question of protein network alignment is becoming central to systems biology. Network alignment is further delineated into two sub-problems: local alignment, to find small conserved motifs across networks, and global alignment, which attempts to find a best mapping between all nodes of the two networks. In this article, our aim is to improve upon existing global alignment results. Better network alignment will enable, among other things, more accurate identification of functional orthologs across species.

RESULTS: We introduce IsoRankN (IsoRank-Nibble) a global multiple-network alignment tool based on spectral clustering on the induced graph of pairwise alignment scores. IsoRankN outperforms existing algorithms for global network alignment in coverage and consistency on multiple alignments of the five available eukaryotic networks. Being based on spectral methods, IsoRankN is both error tolerant and computationally efficient.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) dual infection (DI) has been associated with decreased CD4 T-cell counts and increased viral loads; however, the frequency of intrasubtype DI is poorly understood. We used ultradeep sequencing (UDS) to estimate the frequency of DI in a primary infection cohort of predominantly men who have sex with men (MSM).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS:  HIV-1 genomes from longitudinal blood samples of recently infected, therapy-naive participants were interrogated with UDS. DI was confirmed when maximum sequence divergence was excessive and supported by phylogenetic analysis. Coinfection was defined as DI at baseline; superinfection was monoinfection at baseline and DI at a later time point.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS:  Of 118 participants, 7 were coinfected and 10 acquired superinfection. Superinfection incidence rate was 4.96 per 100 person-years (95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.67-9.22); 6 occurred in the first year and 4 in the second. Overall cumulative prevalence of intrasubtype B DI was 14.4\% (95\% CI, 8.6\%-22.1\%). Primary HIV-1 incidence was 4.37 per 100 person-years (95\% CI, 3.56-5.36).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS:  Intrasubtype DI was frequent and comparable to primary infection rates among MSM in San Diego; however, superinfection rates declined over time. DI is likely an important component of the HIV epidemic dynamics, and development of stronger immune responses to the initial infection may protect from superinfection.},

	abstract = {Discord in the estimated gene trees among loci can be attributed to both the process of mutation and incomplete lineage sorting. Effectively modeling these two sources of variation--mutational and coalescent variance--provides two distinct challenges for phylogenetic studies. Despite extensive investigation on mutational models for gene-tree estimation over the past two decades and recent attention to modeling of the coalescent process for phylogenetic estimation, the effects of these two variances have yet to be evaluated simultaneously. Here, we partition the effects of mutational and coalescent processes on phylogenetic accuracy by comparing the accuracy of species trees estimated from gene trees (i.e., the actual coalescent genealogies) with that of species trees estimated from estimated gene trees (i.e., trees estimated from nucleotide sequences, which contain both coalescent and mutational variance). Not only is there a significant contribution of both mutational and coalescent variance to errors in species-tree estimates, but the relative magnitude of the effects on the accuracy of species-tree estimation also differs systematically depending on 1) the timing of divergence, 2) the sampling design, and 3) the method used for species-tree estimation. These findings explain why using more information contained in gene trees (e.g., topology and branch lengths as opposed to just topology) does not necessarily translate into pronounced gains in accuracy, highlighting the strengths and limits of different methods for species-tree estimation. Differences in accuracy scores between methods for different sampling regimes also emphasize that it would be a mistake to assume more computationally intensive species-tree estimation procedures that will always provide better estimates of species trees. To the contrary, the performance of a method depends not only on the method per se but also on the compatibilities between the input genetic data and the method as determined by the relative impact of mutational and coalescent variance.},

We review the genetic and ecological methods that have been used to estimate effective population size in the past and suggest that while genetic methods may often be appropriate for the estimation of Ne and its monitoring ecological methods have the advantage of providing data that can help predict the effect of a changed environment on Ne. Estimation of Ne is particularly complex in populations with overlapping generatiomg and we summarize previous empirical estimates of Ne that used ecological methods in such populations. Since it is often difficult to assess what parameters and assumptions have been used in previous calculations, we suggest a method that provides a good estimate of Ne, makes clear what assumptions are involved, and yet requires a minimum of information. The method is used to analyze data from 14 studies. In 36\% (5) of these studies, our estimate is in excellent agreement with the original and yet we use significantly less informatiorg; in 21\% (3) the original estimate is markedly lower; in 43\% (6) it is markedly higher.

We have isolated a set of clonally related natural Ig heavy chain-light chain pairs from an experimentally infected influenza patient, inferred the unmutated ancestral rearrangements and the maturation intermediates, and synthesized all the antibodies using recombinant methods. The lineage exhibits a remarkably uniform rate of improvement of the effective affinity to influenza hemagglutinin (HA) over evolutionary time, increasing 1000-fold overall from the unmutated ancestor to the best of the observed antibodies. Furthermore, analysis of selection reveals that selection and mutation bias were concordant even at the level of maturation to a single antigen. Substantial improvement in affinity to HA occurred along mutationally preferred paths in sequence space and was thus strongly facilitated by the underlying local codon biases.},

No strict temporal order was evident, with point mutations and rearrangements affecting the most common breast cancer genes, including PIK3CA, TP53, PTEN, BRCA2 and MYC, occurring early in some tumors and late in others.

Measures of phylogenetic signal are widely used in ecological and evolutionary research, and are recently gaining traction in viral evolutionary studies. Standard estimators of phylogenetic signal frequently condition on data summary statistics of the repeated trait observations and fixed phylogenetics trees, resulting in information loss and potential bias. To incorporate the observation process and phylogenetic uncertainty in a model-based approach, we develop a novel Bayesian inference method to simultaneously estimate the evolutionary history and phylogenetic signal from molecular sequence data and repeated multivariate traits. Our approach builds upon a phylogenetic diffusion framework that model continuous trait evolution as a Brownian motion process and incorporates Pagel's lambda transformation parameter to estimate dependence among traits. We provide a computationally efficient inference implementation in the BEAST software package. We evaluate the synthetic performance of the Bayesian estimator of phylogenetic signal against standard estimators, and demonstrate the use of our coherent framework to address several virus-host evolutionary questions, including virulence heritability for HIV, antigenic evolution in influenza and HIV, and Drosophila sensitivity to sigma virus infection. Finally, we discuss model extensions that will make useful contributions to our flexible framework for simultaneously studying sequence and trait evolution.},

	abstract = {The field of phylogenetics is on the cusp of a major revolution, enabled by new methods of data collection that leverage both genomic resources and recent advances in DNA sequencing. Previous phylogenetic work has required labor-intensive marker development coupled with single-locus PCR and DNA sequencing on a clade-by-clade and marker-by-marker basis. Here, we present a new, cost-efficient, and rapid approach to obtaining data from hundreds of genes for potentially hundreds of individuals for deep and shallow phylogenetic studies. Specifically, we designed probes for target enrichment of {\textgreater}500 loci in highly-conserved anchor regions of vertebrate genomes (flanked by less conserved regions) from five model species and tested enrichment efficiency in non-model species up to 254 million years divergent from the nearest model. We found that hybrid enrichment using conserved probes (anchored enrichment) can recover a large number of unlinked loci that are useful at a diversity of phylogenetic timescales. This new approach has the potential to not only expedite resolution of deep-scale portions of the Tree of Life but also to greatly accelerate resolution of the large number of shallow clades that remain unresolved. The combination of low cost (1\% of the cost of traditional Sanger sequencing and 3.5\% of the cost of high-throughput amplicon sequencing for projects on the scale of 500 loci 100 individuals) and rapid data collection (2 weeks of laboratory time) are expected to make this approach tractable even for researchers working on systems with limited or non-existent genomic resources.},

The performance of phylogenetic reconstruction methods where the underlying data are generated by a mixture model has stimulated considerable recent debate. Much of the controversy stems from simulations of mixture model data on a given tree topology for which reconstruction algorithms output a tree of a different topology; these findings were held up to show the shortcomings of particular tree reconstruction methods. In so doing, the underlying assumption was that mixture model data on one topology can be distinguished from data evolved on an unmixed tree of another topology given enough data and the "correct" method. Here we show that this assumption can be false. For biologists, our results imply that, for example, the combined data from two genes whose phylogenetic trees differ only in terms of branch lengths can perfectly fit a tree of a different topology.},

	abstract = {Genetically diverse pathogens (such as Human Immunodeficiency virus type 1, HIV-1) are frequently stratified into phylogenetically or immunologically defined subtypes for classification purposes. Computational identification of such subtypes is helpful in surveillance, epidemiological analysis and detection of novel variants, e.g., circulating recombinant forms in HIV-1. A number of conceptually and technically different techniques have been proposed for determining the subtype of a query sequence, but there is not a universally optimal approach. We present a model-based phylogenetic method for automatically subtyping an HIV-1 (or other viral or bacterial) sequence, mapping the location of breakpoints and assigning parental sequences in recombinant strains as well as computing confidence levels for the inferred quantities. Our Subtype Classification Using Evolutionary ALgorithms (SCUEAL) procedure is shown to perform very well in a variety of simulation scenarios, runs in parallel when multiple sequences are being screened, and matches or exceeds the performance of existing approaches on typical empirical cases. We applied SCUEAL to all available polymerase (pol) sequences from two large databases, the Stanford Drug Resistance database and the UK HIV Drug Resistance Database. Comparing with subtypes which had previously been assigned revealed that a minor but substantial (approximately 5\%) fraction of pure subtype sequences may in fact be within- or inter-subtype recombinants. A free implementation of SCUEAL is provided as a module for the HyPhy package and the Datamonkey web server. Our method is especially useful when an accurate automatic classification of an unknown strain is desired, and is positioned to complement and extend faster but less accurate methods. Given the increasingly frequent use of HIV subtype information in studies focusing on the effect of subtype on treatment, clinical outcome, pathogenicity and vaccine design, the importance of accurate, robust and extensible subtyping procedures is clear.},

	abstract = {Phylogenies of highly genetically variable viruses such as HIV-1 are potentially informative of epidemiological dynamics. Several studies have demonstrated the presence of clusters of highly related HIV-1 sequences, particularly among recently HIV-infected individuals, which have been used to argue for a high transmission rate during acute infection. Using a large set of HIV-1 subtype B pol sequences collected from men who have sex with men, we demonstrate that virus from recent infections tend to be phylogenetically clustered at a greater rate than virus from patients with chronic infection ('excess clustering') and also tend to cluster with other recent HIV infections rather than chronic, established infections ('excess co-clustering'), consistent with previous reports. To determine the role that a higher infectivity during acute infection may play in excess clustering and co-clustering, we developed a simple model of HIV infection that incorporates an early period of intensified transmission, and explicitly considers the dynamics of phylogenetic clusters alongside the dynamics of acute and chronic infected cases. We explored the potential for clustering statistics to be used for inference of acute stage transmission rates and found that no single statistic explains very much variance in parameters controlling acute stage transmission rates. We demonstrate that high transmission rates during the acute stage is not the main cause of excess clustering of virus from patients with early/acute infection compared to chronic infection, which may simply reflect the shorter time since transmission in acute infection. Higher transmission during acute infection can result in excess co-clustering of sequences, while the extent of clustering observed is most sensitive to the fraction of infections sampled.},

Bootstrap resampling can be used for this purpose (Hasegawa et al. 1988; Hasegawa and Kishino 1989), but it imposes a great computation burden. To overcome this difficulty, we developed a new method for estimating the variance by expressing it explicitly.},

These events are crucial to account for when reconstructing the history of species, and they play a fundamental role in the evolution of genomes, the diversification of organisms and the emergence of new cellular functions.

In a series of tests on Haemophilus influenzae , Helicobacter pylori and other complete microbial genomes, this system has proven to be very accurate at locating virtually all the genes in these sequences, outperforming previous methods. A conservative estimate based on experiments on H.pylori and H. influenzae is that the system finds {\textgreater}97\% of all genes. GLIMMER uses interpolated Markov models (IMMs) as a framework for capturing dependencies between nearby nucleotides in a DNA sequence. An IMM-based method makes predictions based on a variable context; i.e., a variable-length oligomer in a DNA sequence. The context used by GLIMMER changes depending on the local composition of the sequence. As a result, GLIMMER is more flexible and more powerful than fixed-order Markov methods, which have previously been the primary content-based technique for finding genes in microbial DNA.},

	abstract = {Metagenomics is revolutionizing our understanding ofmicrobial communities, showing that their structure and composition have profound effects on the ecosystem and in a variety of health and disease conditions. Despite the flourishing of new analysis methods, current ap- proaches based on statistical comparisons between high-level taxonomic classes often fail to identify themicrobial taxa that are differentially distributed between sets of samples, since in many cases the taxonomic schema do not allow an adequate description of the structure of the microbiota. This constitutes a severe limitation to the use of metagenomic data in therapeutic and diagnostic applications. To provide a more robust statistical frame- work, we introduce a class of feature-weighting algorithms that discriminate the taxa re- sponsible for the classification of metagenomic samples. Themethod unambiguously groups the relevant taxa into clades without relying on pre-defined taxonomic categories, thus including in the analysis also those sequences for which a taxonomic classification is difficult. The phylogenetic clades are weighted and ranked according to their abundance measuring their contribution to the differentiation of the classes of samples, and a criterion is provided to define a reduced set ofmost relevant clades. Applying themethod to public datasets, we show that the data-driven definition of relevant phylogenetic clades accom- plished by our ranking strategy identifies features in the samples that are lost if phylogenetic relationships are not considered, improving our ability to mine metagenomic datasets. Com- parison with supervised classification methods currently used in metagenomic data analy- sis highlights the advantages of using phylogenetic information.},

The gut microbiota is believed to be directly involved in colorectal carcinogenesis. The identity and functional capacity of the adenoma- or carcinoma-related gut microbe(s), however, have not been surveyed in a comprehensive manner. Here we perform a metagenome-wide association study (MGWAS) on stools from advanced adenoma and carcinoma patients and from healthy subjects, revealing microbial genes, strains and functions enriched in each group. An analysis of potential risk factors indicates that high intake of red meat relative to fruits and vegetables appears to associate with outgrowth of bacteria that might contribute to a more hostile gut environment. These findings suggest that faecal microbiome-based strategies may be useful for early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal adenoma or carcinoma.},

We focused upon Blautia, a single microbial genus that is important for nutrient assimilation as preliminary work suggested host-related patterns within members of this genus. In our dataset of 57 M sequence reads of the V6 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene in samples collected from seven host species, we identified 200 high-resolution taxonomic units within Blautia using oligotyping. Our analysis revealed 13 host-specific oligotypes that occurred exclusively in fecal samples of humans (three oligotypes), swine (six oligotypes), cows (one oligotype), deer (one oligotype), or chickens (two oligotypes). We identified an additional 171 oligotypes that exhibited differential abundance patterns among all the host species. Blautia oligotypes in the human population obtained from sewage and fecal samples displayed remarkable continuity. Oligotypes from only 10 Brazilian human fecal samples collected from individuals in a rural village encompassed 97\% of all Blautia oligotypes found in a Brazilian sewage sample from a city of three million people. Further, 75\% of the oligotypes in Brazilian human fecal samples matched those in US sewage samples, implying that a universal set of Blautia strains may be shared among culturally and geographically distinct human populations. Such strains can serve as universal markers to assess human fecal contamination in environmental samples. Our results indicate that host-specificity and host-preference patterns of organisms within this genus are driven by host physiology more than dietary habits.},

Analysis and interpretation of the human TCR repertoire are hampered by its size and stochastic variation and by the diversity of Ags and Ag-presenting molecules encoded by the MHC, but are highly desirable and would greatly impact fundamental and clinical immunology. A subset of the TCR repertoire is formed by invariant T cells. Invariant T cells express interdonor-conserved TCRs and recognize a limited set of Ags, presented by nonpolymorphic Ag-presenting molecules. Discovery of the three known invariant T cell populations has been a tedious and slow process, identifying them one by one. Because conservation of the TCR α-chain of invariant T cells is much higher than the β-chain, and because the TCR α-chain V gene segment TRAV1-2 is used by two of the three known invariant TCRs, we employed next-generation sequencing of TCR α-chains that contain the TRAV1-2 gene segment to identify 16 invariant TCRs shared among many blood donors. Frequency analysis of individual clones indicates these T cells are expanded in many donors, implying an important role in human immunity. This approach extends the number of known interdonor-conserved TCRs and suggests that many more exist and that these TCR patterns can be used to systematically evaluate human Ag exposure.},

One way to monitor and track B cell clones is to perform large-scale sampling of bulk cell populations, amplifying, and sequencing antibody gene rearrangements by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Here, we describe a series of computational approaches for estimating B cell clone size in NGS immune repertoire profiling data of antibody heavy chain gene rearrangements. We define three different measures of B cell clone size-copy numbers, instances, and unique sequences-and show how these measures can be used to rank clones, analyze their diversity, and study their distribution within and between individuals. We provide a detailed, step-by-step procedure for performing these analyses using two different data sets of spleen samples from human organ donors. In the first data set, 19 independently generated biological replicates from a single individual are analyzed for B cell clone size, diversity and sampling sufficiency for clonal overlap analysis. In the second data set, B cell clones are compared in eight different organ donors. We comment upon frequently encountered pitfalls and offer practical advice with alternative approaches. Overall, we provide a series of pragmatic analytical approaches and show how different clone size measures can be used to study the clonal landscape in bulk B cell immune repertoire profiling data.},

	abstract = {The humoral immune response plays a critical role in controlling infection, and the rapid adaptation to a broad range of pathogens depends on a highly diverse antibody repertoire. The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies in the past decade has enabled insights into this immense diversity. However, not only the variable, but also the constant region of antibodies determines their in vivo activity. Antibody isotypes differ in effector functions and are thought to play a defining role in elicitation of immune responses, both in natural infection and in vaccination. We have developed an Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing protocol that allows determination of the human IgG subtype alongside sequencing full-length antibody variable heavy chain regions. We thereby took advantage of the Illumina procedure containing two additional short reads as identifiers. By performing paired-end sequencing of the variable regions and customizing one of the identifier sequences to distinguish IgG subtypes, IgG transcripts with linked information of variable regions and IgG subtype can be retrieved. We applied our new method to the analysis of the IgG variable region repertoire from PBMC of an HIV-1 infected individual confirmed to have serum antibody reactivity to the Membrane Proximal External Region (MPER) of gp41. We found that IgG3 subtype frequencies in the memory B cell compartment increased after halted treatment and coincided with increased plasma antibody reactivity against the MPER domain. The sequencing strategy we developed is not restricted to analysis of IgG. It can be adopted for any Ig subtyping and beyond that for any research question where phasing of distant regions on the same amplicon is needed.},

This is a particularly acute problem for holocentric nematodes because of the large number of satellite DNA sequences found throughout their genomes. These have been recalcitrant to most genome sequencing methods. At the same time, many nematodes are parasites and some represent a serious threat to human health. There is a pressing need for better molecular characterization of animal and plant parasitic nematodes. The advent of long-read DNA sequencing methods offers the promise of resolving complex genomes. Using Nippostrongylus brasiliensis as a test case, applying improved base-calling algorithms and assembly methods, we demonstrate the feasibility of de novo genome assembly matching current community standards using only MinION long reads. In doing so, we uncovered an unexpected diversity of very long and complex DNA sequences repeated throughout the N. brasiliensis genome, including massive tandem repeats of tRNA genes. Base-calling and assembly methods have improved sufficiently that de novo genome assembly of large complex genomes is possible using only long reads. The method has the added advantage of preserving haplotypic variants and so has the potential to be used in population analyses.},

This effective negation of stochastic error from large data sets is important, but longer sequences exacerbate the potential for biases (systematic error) to be positively misleading. Indeed, when we analyzed the same data set using minimum evolution optimality criteria, an alternative tree received 100\% bootstrap support. We identified a compositional bias as responsible for this inconsistency and showed that it is reduced effectively by coding the nucleotides as purines and pyrimidines (RY-coding), reinforcing the original tree.

	abstract = {Fungi are phylogenetically diverse organisms found in nearly every environment as key contributors to the processes of nutrient cycling and decomposition. To date, most fungal diversity has been documented from terrestrial habitats leaving aquatic habitats underexplored. In particular, comparatively little is known about fungi inhabiting freshwater lakes, particularly the benthic zone, which may serve as an untapped resource for fungal biodiversity. Advances in technology allowing for direct sequencing of DNA from environmental samples provide a new opportunity to investigate freshwater benthic fungi. In this study, we employed both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods to evaluate the diversity of fungi in one of the largest freshwater systems on Earth, the North American Laurentian Great Lakes. This study presents the first comprehensive survey of fungi from sediment from Lake Michigan and Lake Superior, resulting in 465 fungal taxa with only 7\% of sequence overlap between these two methods. Additionally, culture-independent analyses of the ITS1 and ITS2 regions revealed 49\% and 72\%, respectively, of the OTUs did not match a described fungal taxonomic group below kingdom Fungi. The low level of sequence overlap between methods and high percentage of fungal taxa that can only be classified at the kingdom level suggests an immense amount of fungal diversity remains to be studied in these aquatic fungal communities.},

	abstract = {Although segmental duplications (SDs) represent hotbeds for genomic rearrangements and emergence of new genes, there are still no easy-to-use tools for identifying SDs. Moreover, while most previous studies focused on recently emerged SDs, detection of ancient SDs remains an open problem. We developed an SDquest algorithm for SD finding and applied it to analyzing SDs in human, gorilla, and mouse genomes. Our results demonstrate that previous studies missed many SDs in these genomes and show that SDs account for at least 6.05\% of the human genome (version hg19), a 17\% increase as compared to the previous estimate. Moreover, SDquest classified 6.42\% of the latest GRCh38 version of the human genome as SDs, a large increase as compared to previous studies. We thus propose to re-evaluate evolution of SDs based on their accurate representation across multiple genomes. Toward this goal, we analyzed the complex mosaic structure of SDs and decomposed mosaic SDs into elementary SDs, a prerequisite for follow-up evolutionary analysis. We also introduced the concept of the breakpoint graph of mosaic SDs that revealed SD hotspots and suggested that some SDs may have originated from circular extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA), not unlike ecDNA that contributes to accelerated evolution in cancer.},

	abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is an important nosocomial and community-acquired pathogen. Its genetic plasticity has facilitated the evolution of many virulent and drug-resistant strains, presenting a major and constantly changing clinical challenge. We sequenced the approximately 2.8-Mbp genomes of two disease-causing S. aureus strains isolated from distinct clinical settings: a recent hospital-acquired representative of the epidemic methicillin-resistant S. aureus EMRSA-16 clone (MRSA252), a clinically important and globally prevalent lineage; and a representative of an invasive community-acquired methicillin-susceptible S. aureus clone (MSSA476). A comparative-genomics approach was used to explore the mechanisms of evolution of clinically important S. aureus genomes and to identify regions affecting virulence and drug resistance. The genome sequences of MRSA252 and MSSA476 have a well conserved core region but differ markedly in their accessory genetic elements. MRSA252 is the most genetically diverse S. aureus strain sequenced to date: approximately 6\% of the genome is novel compared with other published genomes, and it contains several unique genetic elements. MSSA476 is methicillin-susceptible, but it contains a novel Staphylococcal chromosomal cassette (SCC) mec-like element (designated SCC(476)), which is integrated at the same site on the chromosome as SCCmec elements in MRSA strains but encodes a putative fusidic acid resistance protein. The crucial role that accessory elements play in the rapid evolution of S. aureus is clearly illustrated by comparing the MSSA476 genome with that of an extremely closely related MRSA community-acquired strain; the differential distribution of large mobile elements carrying virulence and drug-resistance determinants may be responsible for the clinically important phenotypic differences in these strains.},

	abstract = {© 2018 Botanical Society of America. Premise of the Study: The slipper orchids (Cypripedioideae) are a morphologically distinct subfamily of Orchidaceae. They also have some of the largest genomes in the orchids, which may be due to polyploidy or some other mechanism of genome evolution. We generated 10 transcriptomes and incorporated existing RNA-seq data to infer a multilocus nuclear phylogeny of the Cypripedioideae and to determine whether a whole-genome duplication event (WGD) correlated with the large genome size of this subfamily. Knowing more about timing of ancient polyploidy events can help us understand the evolution of one of the most species-rich plant families. Methods: Transcriptome data were used to identify low-copy orthologous genes to infer a phylogeny of Orchidaceae and to identify paralogs to place any WGD events on the species tree. Key Results: Our transcriptome phylogeny confirmed relationships published in previous studies that used fewer markers but incorporated more taxa. We did not find a WGD event at the base of the slipper orchids; however, we did identify one on the Orchidaceae stem lineage. We also confirmed the presence of a previously identified WGD event deeper in the monocot phylogeny. Conclusions: Although WGD has played a role in the evolution of Orchidaceae, polyploidy does not appear to be responsible for the large genome size of slipper orchids. The conserved set of 775 largely single-copy nuclear genes identified in this study should prove useful in future studies of orchid evolution.},

Somatic rearrangements were systematically characterized in eight high-grade serous and five clear cell ovarian cancer genomes and we report here the identification of {\textgreater} 600 somatic rearrangements. Recurrent rearrangements of the transcriptional regulator gene, TSHZ3, were found in three of eight serous cases. Comparison to breast, pancreatic and prostate cancer genomes revealed that a subset of ovarian cancers share a marked tandem duplication phenotype with triple-negative breast cancers. The tandem duplication phenotype was not linked to BRCA1/2 mutation, suggesting that other common mechanisms or carcinogenic exposures are operative. High-grade serous cancers arising in women with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation showed a high frequency of small chromosomal deletions. These findings indicate that BRCA1/2 germline mutation may contribute to widespread structural change and that other undefined mechanism(s), which are potentially shared with triple-negative breast cancer, promote tandem chromosomal duplications that sculpt the ovarian cancer genome.},

We mapped phylogenetic distribution of paleopolyploidy events by both tree-based and distance-based methods, and explicitly tested scenarios for paleo-allopolyploidy. We identified twenty-six paleopolyploidy events distributed throughout Caryophyllales, and using novel techniques inferred two to be paleo-allopolyploidy.

	abstract = {Group Astreptococcus (GAS) is a gram-positive bacterial pathogen that causes various suppurative infections and nonsuppurative sequelae. Since the late 1980s, streptococcal toxic-shock like syndrome (STSS) and severe invasive GAS infections have been reported globally. Here we sequenced the genome of serotype M3 strain SSI-1, isolated from an STSS patient in Japan, and compared it with those of other GAS strains. The SSI-1 genome is composed of 1,884,275 bp, and 1.7 Mb of the sequence is highly conserved relative to strain SF370 (serotype M1) and MGAS8232 (serotype M18), and almost completely conserved relative to strain MGAS315 (serotype M3). However, a large genomic rearrangement has been shown to occur across the replication axis between the homologous rrn-comX1 regions and between two prophage-coding regions across the replication axis. Atotal of 1 Mb of chromosomal DNA is inverted across the replication axis. Interestingly, the recombinations between the prophage regions are within the phage genes, and the genes encoding superantigens and mitogenic factors are interchanged between two prophages. This genomic rearrangement occurs in 65\% of clinical isolates (64/94) collected after 1990, whereas it is found in only 25\% of clinical isolates (7/28) collected before 1985. These observations indicate that streptococcal phages represent important plasticity regions in the GAS chromosome where recombination between homologous phage genes can occur and result not only in new phage derivatives, but also in large chromosomal rearrangements.},

Here, we address the relationships among genera within the Vespinae using transcriptomic (RNA-seq) data. We sequenced the transcriptomes of six vespid wasps, including three of the four genera recognized in the Vespinae, combined our data with publicly available transcriptomes, and assembled two matrices comprising 1,507 and 3,356 putative single-copy genes. The results of our phylogenomic analyses recover Dolichovespula as more closely related to Vespa than to Vespula, therefore challenging the prevailing hypothesis of yellowjacket (Vespula + Dolichovespula) monophyly. This suggests that traits such as large colony size and high paternity arose in the genus Vespula following its early divergence from the remaining vespine genera.},

	abstract = {e systems over short timescales. However, the effects in more complex communities, and over the timescales of continental radiations, are less clear. In this dissertation, I addressed the relationships between coexistence, morphological evolution, and diversification at multiple spatial and temporal scales, using birds in the family Picidae, which includes woodpeckers and the related piculets and wrynecks. Morphology of these birds is correlated with diet and foraging mode, allowing similarity in morphological measurements to be used as a proxy for ecological similarity. Members of Picidae occur throughout the Americas, Africa, and Eurasia, and local diversity ranges from a single species to up to 13. I first generated a phylogenetic hypothesis of Picidae, and then tested predictions from community ecology and macroevolutionary theory at the community level and across the entire global radiation of Picidae. In Chapter 1, I inferred phylogenetic relationships among {\textasciitilde}75\% of extant species of Picidae, the most comprehensive molecular phylogeny of the family to date, using publicly available sequence data augmented by targeted collection of new data. While most results matched previous findings, a few species with new molecular data were placed in unexpected regions of the tree, and several genera as currently delineated appear to be paraphyletic. Relationships within most genera and previously described tribes were well resolved, but relationships among most major clades remained unclear. A number of tightly spacedbranching events near the base of the family were not resolved with available data. In Chapter 2, I evaluated the roles of ecological assortment of species and in situ trait evolution in driving trait distributions in communities of North American woodpeckers. I used multiple null models and metrics of community trait distributions to test for deviations from randomness in six communities including a total of 10 species. I recovered a signal of divergent displacement across all populations and all communities, suggesting local evolution away from morphologically most similar species. However, trait distributions in most individual communities did not differ from random expectations. In average size and overall morphology, one community showed evidence of species sorting for dissimilar traits. In the size-scaled shape data, I found evidence of divergent and convergent local evolution in one community each. These results suggest that trait differences are related to both species sorting and local evolution, but that other processes or a lack of statistical power prevent detection of effects in many communities. In Chapter 3, I tested for relationships between coexistence and rates and modes of diversification and trait evolution across all Picidae. I used phylogenetic comparative methods to evaluate correlations among subclades of Picidae in relevant variables. I found strong and consistent positive correlations between geographic range overlap, rates of diversification, and rates of shape evolution— but not body size or overall morphological evolution. In addition, time-dependent models of morphological evolution and diversification fit better to subclades with greater range overlap. Taken together, these findings suggest that coexistence with similar species does affect evolution in Picidae. Shape evolution shows clear connections with coexistence in both the community-level and family-wide comparative analyses. The community analyses suggest that coexistence is the cause, rather than the consequence, of this trait evolution, as the trait changes are more spatially restricted and temporally recent than apparent coexistence among many of the species. Variation in diversification rates may be driven by other factors that covary with local diversity and evolution in body shape. Future work in this group should focus on solving the remaining puzzles in phylogenetic relationships, determining the contribution of body size and shape to competitive interactions, and understanding possible relationships of other variables with diversification, morphological evolution, and coexistence.

	abstract = {Motivation: Most models of genome evolution integrating gene duplications, losses and chromosomal rearrangements are computationally intract able, even when comparing only two genomes. This prevents large-scale studies that consider different types of genome structural variations. Results: We define an ‘adjacency phylogenetic tree’ that describes the evolution of an adjacency, a neighborhood relation between two genes, by speciation, duplication or loss of one or both genes, and rearrangement. We describe an algorithm that, given a species tree and a set of gene trees where the leaves are connected by adjacencies, computes an adjacency forest that minimizes the number of gains and breakages of adjacencies (caused by rearrangements) and runs in polynomial time. We use this algorithm to reconstruct contiguous regions of mammalian and plant ancestral genomes in a few minutes for a dozen species and several thousand genes. We show that this method yields reduced conflict between ancestral adjacencies.

	abstract = {Tepsin is currently the only accessory trafficking protein identified in adaptor-related protein 4 (AP4)-coated vesicles originating at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The molecular basis for interactions between AP4 subunits and motifs in the tepsin C-terminus have been characterized, but the biological role of tepsin remains unknown. We determined X-ray crystal structures of the tepsin epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) and VHS/ENTH-like domains. Our data reveal unexpected structural features that suggest key functional differences between these and similar domains in other trafficking proteins. The tepsin ENTH domain lacks helix0, helix8 and a lipid binding pocket found in epsin1/2/3. These results explain why tepsin requires AP4 for its membrane recruitment and further suggest ENTH domains cannot be defined solely as lipid binding modules. The VHS domain lacks helix8 and thus contains fewer helices than other VHS domains. Structural data explain biochemical and biophysical evidence that tepsin VHS does not mediate known VHS functions, including recognition of dileucine-based cargo motifs or ubiquitin. Structural comparisons indicate the domains are very similar to each other, and phylogenetic analysis reveals their evolutionary pattern within the domain superfamily. Phylogenetics and comparative genomics further show tepsin within a monophyletic clade that diverged away from epsins early in evolutionary history ({\textasciitilde}1500 million years ago). Together, these data provide the first detailed molecular view of tepsin and suggest tepsin structure and function diverged away from other epsins. More broadly, these data highlight the challenges inherent in classifying and understanding protein function based only on sequence and structure.},

	abstract = {Previous studies suggesting a link between Escherichia coli phylogenetic groups and extraintestinal virulence have been hampered by the difficulty in establishing the intrinsic virulence of a bacterial strain. Indeed, unidentified virulence factors do exist, and the susceptibility of the host to infection is highly variable. To overcome these difficulties, we have developed a mouse model of extraintestinal virulence to test the virulence of the strains under normalized conditions. We then assessed the phylogenetic relationships compared to the E. coli reference (ECOR) collection, the presence of several known virulence determinants, and the lethality to mice of 82 human adult E. coli strains isolated from normal feces and during the course of extraintestinal infections. Commensal strains belong mainly to phylogenetic groups A and B1, are devoid of virulence determinants, and do not kill the mice. Strains exhibiting the same characteristics as the commensal strains can be isolated under pathogenic conditions, thus indicating the role of host-dependent factors, such as susceptibility linked to underlying disease, in the development of infection. Some strains of phylogenetic groups A, B1, and D are able to kill the mice, their virulence being most often correlated with the presence of virulence determinants. Lastly, strains of the B2 phylogenetic group represent a divergent lineage of highly virulent strains which kill the mice at high frequency and possess the highest level of virulence determinants. The observed link between virulence and phylogeny could correspond to the necessity of virulence determinants in a genetic background that is adequate for the emergence of a virulent clone, an expression of the interdependency of pathogenicity and metabolic activities in pathogenic bacteria.},

Here we report the first near-complete assembly of T. aestivum, using deep sequencing coverage from a combination of short Illumina reads and very long Pacific Biosciences reads. The final assembly contains 15,344,693,583 bases and has a weighted average (N50) contig size of 232,659 bases. This represents by far the most complete and contiguous assembly of the wheat genome to date, providing a strong foundation for future genetic studies of this important food crop.

	abstract = {Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) strains of human and avian origin show similarities that suggest that the avian strains potentially have zoonotic properties. However, the phylogenetic relationships between avian and human ExPEC strains are poorly documented, so this possibility is difficult to assess. We used PCR-based phylotyping and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to determine the phylogenetic relationships between 39 avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) strains of serogroups O1, O2, O18, and O78 and 51 human ExPEC strains. We also compared the virulence genotype and pathogenicity for chickens of APEC strains and human ExPEC strains. Twenty-eight of the 30 APEC strains of serogroups O1, O2, and O18 were classified by MLST into the same subcluster (B2-1) of phylogenetic group B2, whereas the 9 APEC strains of serogroup O78 were in phylogenetic groups D (3 strains) and B1 (6 strains). Human ExPEC strains were closely related to APEC strains in each of these three subclusters. The 28 avian and 25 human strains belonging to phylogenetic subcluster B2-1 all expressed the K1 antigen and presented no significant differences concerning the presence of other virulence factors. Moreover, human strains of this phylogenetic subcluster were highly virulent for chicks, so no host specificity was identified. Thus, APEC strains of serotypes O1:K1, O2:K1, and O18:K1 belong to the same highly pathogenic clonal group as human E. coli strains of the same serotypes isolated from cases of neonatal meningitis, urinary tract infections, and septicemia. These APEC strains constitute a potential zoonotic risk.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: NADPH oxidases (NOX) are ROS producing enzymes that perform essential roles in cell physiology, including cell signaling and antimicrobial defense. This gene family is present in most eukaryotes, suggesting a common ancestor. To date, only a limited number of phylogenetic studies of metazoan NOXes have been performed, with few arthropod genes. In arthropods, only NOX5 and DUOX genes have been found and a gene called NOXm was found in mosquitoes but its origin and function has not been examined. In this study, we analyzed the evolution of this gene family in arthropods. A thorough search of genomes and transcriptomes was performed enabling us to browse most branches of arthropod phylogeny. RESULTS: We have found that the subfamilies NOX5 and DUOX are present in all arthropod groups. We also show that a NOX gene, closely related to NOX4 and previously found only in mosquitoes (NOXm), can also be found in other taxonomic groups, leading us to rename it as NOX4-art. Although the accessory protein p22-phox, essential for NOX1-4 activation, was not found in any of the arthropods studied, NOX4-art of Aedes aegypti encodes an active protein that produces H2O2. Although NOX4-art has been lost in a number of arthropod lineages, it has all the domains and many signature residues and motifs necessary for ROS production and, when silenced, H2O2 production is considerably diminished in A. aegypti cells. CONCLUSIONS: Combining all bioinformatic analyses and laboratory work we have reached interesting conclusions regarding arthropod NOX gene family evolution. NOX5 and DUOX are present in all arthropod lineages but it seems that a NOX2-like gene was lost in the ancestral lineage leading to Ecdysozoa. The NOX4-art gene originated from a NOX4-like ancestor and is functional. Although no p22-phox was observed in arthropods, there was no evidence of neo-functionalization and this gene probably produces H2O2 as in other metazoan NOX4 genes. Although functional and present in the genomes of many species, NOX4-art was lost in a number of arthropod lineages.},

Here, we introduce a mathematical framework that begins to address this problem. By using samples with accurate data sets, we can reconstruct relatively complex temporal sequences of rearrangements and provide an assembly of genomic segments into digital karyotypes.

Important parameters to consider when sequencing antibody repertoires include the methodology, the B-cell population and clinical characteristics of the individuals analysed, and the bioinformatic analysis. Although focused sequencing of immunoglobulin heavy chains or complement determining regions can be utilized to monitor particular immune responses and B-cell malignancies, high-fidelity analysis of the full-length paired heavy and light chains expressed by individual B cells is critical for characterizing functional antibody repertoires. Bioinformatic identification of clonal antibody families and recombinant expression of representative members produces recombinant antibodies that can be used to identify the antigen targets of functional immune responses and to investigate the mechanisms of their protective or pathogenic functions. Integrated analysis of coexpressed functional genes provides the potential to further pinpoint the most important antibodies and clonal families generated during an immune response. Sequencing antibody repertoires is transforming our understanding of immune responses to autoimmunity, vaccination, infection and cancer.

Among Columbea, we identify pigeons and flamingoes as belonging to sister clades.

	abstract = {Until recently, it has been common practice for a phylogenetic analysis to use a single gene sequence from a single individual organism as a proxy for an entire species. With technological advances, it is now becoming more common to collect data sets containing multiple gene loci and multiple individuals per species. These data sets often reveal the need to directly model intraspecies polymorphism and incomplete lineage sorting in phylogenetic estimation procedures. For a single species, coalescent theory is widely used in contemporary population genetics to model intraspecific gene trees. Here, we present a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method for the multispecies coalescent. Our method coestimates multiple gene trees embedded in a shared species tree along with the effective population size of both extant and ancestral species. The inference is made possible by multilocus data from multiple individuals per species. Using a multiindividual data set and a series of simulations of rapid species radiations, we demonstrate the efficacy of our new method. These simulations give some insight into the behavior of the method as a function of sampled individuals, sampled loci, and sequence length. Finally, we compare our new method to both an existing method (BEST 2.2) with similar goals and the supermatrix (concatenation) method. We demonstrate that both BEST and our method have much better estimation accuracy for species tree topology than concatenation, and our method outperforms BEST in divergence time and population size estimation.},

	abstract = {Inferring evolutionary trees has long been a challenging problem for both biologists and computer scientists. In recent years research has concentrated on the quartet method paradigm for inferring evolutionary trees. Quartet methods proceed by first inferring the evolutionary history for every set of four species (resulting in a set Q of inferred quartet topologies) and then recombining these inferred quartet topologies to form an evolutionary tree. This paper presents two results on the quartet method paradigm. The first is a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for recombining the inferred quartet topologies optimally. This is an important result since, to date, there have been no polynomial time algorithms with performance guarantees for quartet methods. To achieve this result the natural denseness of the set Q is exploited. The second result is a new technique, called quartet cleaning, that detects and corrects errors in the set Q with performance guarantees. This result has particular signific...},

	volume = {10},
	url = {http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/302},
	abstract = {Background: Several phylogenetic approaches have been developed to estimate species trees from collections of gene trees. However, maximum likelihood approaches for estimating species trees under the coalescent model are limited. Although the likelihood of a species tree under the multispecies coalescent model has already been derived by Rannala and Yang, it can be shown that the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the species tree (topology, branch lengths, and population sizes) from gene trees under this formula does not exist. In this paper, we develop a pseudo-likelihood function of the species tree to obtain maximum pseudo-likelihood estimates (MPE) of species trees, with branch lengths of the species tree in coalescent units. Results: We show that the MPE of the species tree is statistically consistent as the number M of genes goes to infinity. In addition, the probability that the MPE of the species tree matches the true species tree converges to 1 at rate O(M -1). The simulation results confirm that the maximum pseudo-likelihood approach is statistically consistent even when the species tree is in the anomaly zone. We applied our method, Maximum Pseudo-likelihood for Estimating Species Trees (MP-EST) to a mammal dataset. The four major clades found in the MP-EST tree are consistent with those in the Bayesian concatenation tree. The bootstrap supports for the species tree estimated by the MP-EST method are more reasonable than the posterior probability supports given by the Bayesian concatenation method in reflecting the level of uncertainty in gene trees and controversies over the relationship of four major groups of placental mammals. Conclusions: MP-EST can consistently estimate the topology and branch lengths (in coalescent units) of the species tree. Although the pseudo-likelihood is derived from coalescent theory, and assumes no gene flow or horizontal gene transfer (HGT), the MP-EST method is robust to a small amount of HGT in the dataset. In addition, increasing the number of genes does not increase the computational time substantially. The MP-EST method is fast for analyzing datasets that involve a large number of genes but a moderate number of species.},

	abstract = {Viral phylodynamics is defined as the study of how epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes act and potentially interact to shape viralphylogenies. Since the coining of the term in 2004, research on viral phylodynamics has focused on transmission dynamics in an effort to shed light on how these dynamics impact viral genetic variation. Transmission dynamics can be considered at the level of cells within an infected host, individual hosts within a population, or entire populations of hosts. Many viruses, especially RNA viruses, rapidly accumulate genetic variation because of short generation times and high mutation rates. Patterns of viral genetic variation are therefore heavily influenced by how quickly transmission occurs and by which entities transmit to one another. Patterns of viral genetic variation will also be affected by selection acting on viral phenotypes. Although viruses can differ with respect to many phenotypes, phylodynamic studies have to date tended to focus on a limited number of viral phenotypes. These include virulence phenotypes, phenotypes associated with viral transmissibility, cell or tissue tropism phenotypes, and antigenic phenotypes that can facilitate escape from host immunity. Due to the impact that transmission dynamics and selection can have on viral genetic variation, viral phylogenies can therefore be used to investigate important epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes, such as epidemic spread[2], spatio-temporal dynamics including metapopulation dynamics[3], zoonotic transmission, tissue tropism[4], and antigenic drift[5]. The quantitative investigation of these processes through the consideration of viral phylogenies is the central aim of viral phylodynamics.},

However, existing methods either use summary statistics (gene trees) to carry out estimation, ignoring an important source of variability in the estimates, or involve computationally-intensive Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms that don't scale well to whole-genome data sets. RESULTS: We develop a method to infer relationships among quartets of taxa under the coalescent model using techniques from algebraic statistics. Uncertainty in the estimated relationships is quantified using the nonparametric bootstrap. The performance of our method is assessed with simulated data. We then describe how our method could be used for species tree inference in larger taxon samples, and demonstrate its utility using data sets for Sistrurus rattlesnakes and for soybeans.

	abstract = {A wide range of evolutionary models for species-level (and higher) diversification have been developed. These models can be used to test evolutionary hypotheses and provide comparisons with phylogenetic trees constructed from real data. To carry out these tests and comparisons, it is often necessary to sample, or simulate, trees from the evolutionary models. Sampling trees from these models is more complicated than it may appear at first glance, necessitating careful consideration and mathematical rigor. Seemingly straightforward sampling methods may produce trees that have systematically biased shapes or branch lengths. This is particularly problematic as there is no simple method for determining whether the sampled trees are appropriate. In this paper, we show why a commonly used simple sampling approach (SSA)-simulating trees forward in time until n species are first reached-should only be applied to the simplest pure birth model, the Yule model. We provide an alternative general sampling approach (GSA) that can be applied to most other models. Furthermore, we introduce the constant-rate birth-death model sampling approach, which samples trees very efficiently from a widely used class of models. We explore the bias produced by SSA and identify situations in which this bias is particularly pronounced. We show that using SSA can lead to erroneous conclusions: When using the inappropriate SSA, the variance of a gradually evolving trait does not correlate with the age of the tree; when the correct GSA is used, the trait variance correlates with tree age. The algorithms presented here are available in the Perl Bio::Phylo package, as a stand-alone program TreeSample, and in the R TreeSim package.},

Six orders of charophyte green algae, in addition to embryophytes, comprise the Streptophyta s.l. Previous studies have focused on reconstructing the phylogeny of organisms tied to this key colonization event, but wildly conflicting results have sparked a contentious debate over which lineage gave rise to land plants. The dominant view has been that ‘stoneworts,’ or Charales, are the sister lineage, but an alternative hypothesis supports the Zygnematales (often referred to as ‘‘pond scum’’) as the sister lineage. In this paper, we provide a wellsupported, 160-nuclear-gene phylogenomic analysis supporting the Zygnematales as the closest living relative to land plants. Our study makes two key contributions to the field: 1) the use of an unbiased method to collect a large set of orthologs from deeply diverging species and 2) the use of these data in determining the sister lineage to land plants. We anticipate this updated phylogeny not only will hugely impact lesson plans in introductory biology courses, but also will provide a solid phylogenetic tree for future green-lineage research, whether it be related to plants or green algae.},

	abstract = {Background: Next-generation sequencing has provided a wealth of plastid genome sequence data from an increasingly diverse set of green plants (Viridiplantae). Although these data have helped resolve the phylogeny of numerous clades (e.g., green algae, angiosperms, and gymnosperms), their utility for inferring relationships across all green plants is uncertain. Viridiplantae originated 700-1500 million years ago and may comprise as many as 500,000 species. This clade represents a major source of photosynthetic carbon and contains an immense diversity of life forms, including some of the smallest and largest eukaryotes. Here we explore the limits and challenges of inferring a comprehensive green plant phylogeny from available complete or nearly complete plastid genome sequence data. Results: We assembled protein-coding sequence data for 78 genes from 360 diverse green plant taxa with complete or nearly complete plastid genome sequences available from GenBank. Phylogenetic analyses of the plastid data recovered well-supported backbone relationships and strong support for relationships that were not observed in previous analyses of major subclades within Viridiplantae. However, there also is evidence of systematic error in some analyses. In several instances we obtained strongly supported but conflicting topologies from analyses of nucleotides versus amino acid characters, and the considerable variation in GC content among lineages and within single genomes affected the phylogenetic placement of several taxa. Conclusions: Analyses of the plastid sequence data recovered a strongly supported framework of relationships for green plants. This framework includes: i) the placement of Zygnematophyceace as sister to land plants (Embryophyta), ii) a clade of extant gymnosperms (Acrogymnospermae) with cycads+Ginkgo sister to remaining extant gymnosperms and with gnetophytes (Gnetophyta) sister to non-Pinaceae conifers (Gnecup trees), and iii) within the monilophyte clade (Monilophyta), Equisetales + Psilotales are sister to Marattiales + leptosporangiate ferns. Our analyses also highlight the challenges of using plastid genome sequences in deep-level phylogenomic analyses, and we provide suggestions for future analyses that will likely incorporate plastid genome sequence data for thousands of species. We particularly emphasize the importance of exploring the effects of different partitioning and character coding strategies.

We first use 22,833 sets of orthologs from the nuclear genomes of 101 genera across land plants to reconstruct their phylogenetic relationships. One of the more salient results is the resolution of some enigmatic relationships in seed plant phylogeny, such as the placement of Gnetales as sister to the rest of the gymnosperms. In using this novel phylogenomic approach, we were also able to identify overrepresented functional gene ontology categories in genes that provide positive branch support for major nodes prompting new hypotheses for genes associated with the diversification of angiosperms. For example, RNA interference (RNAi) has played a significant role in the divergence of monocots from other angiosperms, which has experimental support in Arabidopsis and rice. This analysis also implied that the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase IV and V (NRPD2) played a prominent role in the divergence of gymnosperms. This hypothesis is supported by the lack of 24nt siRNA in conifers, the maternal control of small RNA in the seeds of flowering plants, and the emergence of double fertilization in angiosperms. Our approach takes advantage of genomic data to define orthologs, reconstruct relationships, and narrow down candidate genes involved in plant evolution within a phylogenomic view of species' diversification.},

Here, we analyze alternative and more realistic Yule and birth–death models. We show how censoring at the present both makes average branches one half what we might expect and makes pendant and interior branches roughly equal in length. Although dependent on whether we condition on the size of the tree, its age, or both, these results hold both for the Yule model and for birth–death models with moderate extinction. Importantly, the rough equivalency in interior and exterior branch lengths means that the loss of evolutionary history with loss of species can be roughly linear. Under these models, the Tree of Life may offer limited redundancy in the face of ongoing species loss.},

These resolved species trees can be used to ask many questions about trait evolution, including the direction of change and number of times traits have evolved. However, the mapping of traits onto trees generally uses only a single representation of the species tree, ignoring variation in the gene trees used to construct it. Recognizing that genes underlie traits, these results imply that many traits follow topologies that are discordant with the species topology. As a consequence, standard methods for character mapping will incorrectly infer the number of times a trait has evolved. This phenomenon, dubbed “hemiplasy,” poses many problems in analyses of character evolution. Here we outline these problems, explaining where and when they are likely to occur. We offer several ways in which the possible presence of hemiplasy can be diagnosed, and discuss multiple approaches to dealing with the problems presented by underlying gene tree discordance when carrying out character mapping. Finally, we discuss the implications of hemiplasy for general phylogenetic inference, including the possible drawbacks of the widespread push for “resolved” species trees.},

Nonetheless, little work has been done to test the robustness of such methods to violations of their assumptions. Here, we study the performance of two of the most efficient coalescent-based methods, ASTRAL and NJst, in the presence of gene flow. Gene flow violates the assumption that ILS is the sole source of gene tree conflict. We find anomalous gene trees on 3-taxon rooted trees and on 4-taxon unrooted trees. These anomalous trees do not exist under ILS only, but appear because of gene flow. Our simulations show that species-tree methods (and concatenation) may reconstruct the wrong evolutionary history, even from a very large number of well-reconstructed gene trees. In other words, species-tree methods can be inconsistent under gene flow. Our results underline the need for methods like PhyloNet, to account simultaneously for ILS and gene flow in a unified framework. Although much slower, PhyloNet had better accuracy and remained consistent at high levels of gene flow.},

	abstract = {The multispecies coalescent (MSC) model has emerged as a powerful framework for inferring species phylogenies while accounting for ancestral polymorphism and gene tree-species tree conflict. A number of methods have been developed in the past few years to estimate the species tree under the MSC. The full likelihood methods (including maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference) average over the unknown gene trees and accommodate their uncertainties properly but involve intensive computation. The approximate or summary coalescent methods are computationally fast and are applicable to genomic datasets with thousands of loci, but do not make an efficient use of information in the multilocus data. Most of them take the two-step approach of reconstructing the gene trees for multiple loci by phylogenetic methods and then treating the estimated gene trees as observed data, without accounting for their uncertainties appropriately. In this article we review the statistical nature of the species tree estimation problem under the MSC, and explore the conceptual issues and challenges of species tree estimation by focusing mainly on simple cases of three or four closely related species. We use mathematical analysis and computer simulation to demonstrate that large differences in statistical performance may exist between the two classes of methods. We illustrate that several counterintuitive behaviors may occur with the summary methods but they are due to inefficient use of information in the data by summary methods and vanish when the data are analyzed using full-likelihood methods. These include (i) unidentifiability of parameters in the model, (ii) inconsistency in the so-called anomaly zone, (iii) singularity on the likelihood surface, and (iv) deterioration of performance upon addition of more data. We discuss the challenges and strategies of species tree inference for distantly related species when the molecular clock is violated, and highlight the need for improving the computational efficiency and model realism of the likelihood methods as well as the statistical efficiency of the summary methods.},

	abstract = {In recent articles published in Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, Mark Springer and John Gatesy (S\&G) present numerous criticisms of recent implementations and testing of the multispecies coalescent (MSC) model in phylogenomics, popularly known as "species tree" methods. After pointing out errors in alignments and gene tree rooting in recent phylogenomic data sets, particularly in Song et al. (2012) on mammals and Xi et al. (2014) on plants, they suggest that these errors seriously compromise the conclusions of these studies. Additionally, S\&G enumerate numerous perceived violated assumptions and deficiencies in the application of the MSC model in phylogenomics, such as its assumption of neutrality and in particular the use of transcriptomes, which are deemed inappropriate for the MSC because the constituent exons often subtend large regions of chromosomes within which recombination is substantial. We acknowledge these previously reported errors in recent phylogenomic data sets, but disapprove of S\&G's excessively combative and taunting tone. We show that these errors, as well as two nucleotide sorting methods used in the analysis of Amborella, have little impact on the conclusions of those papers. Moreover, several concepts introduced by S\&G and an appeal to "first principles" of phylogenetics in an attempt to discredit MSC models are invalid and reveal numerous misunderstandings of the MSC. Contrary to the claims of S\&G we show that recent computer simulations used to test the robustness of MSC models are not circular and do not unfairly favor MSC models over concatenation. In fact, although both concatenation and MSC models clearly perform well in regions of tree space with long branches and little incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), simulations reveal the erratic behavior of concatenation when subjected to data subsampling and its tendency to produce spuriously confident yet conflicting results in regions of parameter space where MSC models still perform well. S\&G's claims that MSC models explain little or none (0-15\%) of the observed gene tree heterogeneity observed in a mammal data set and that MSC models assume ILS as the only source of gene tree variation are flawed. Overall many of their criticisms of MSC models are invalidated when concatenation is appropriately viewed as a special case of the MSC, which in turn is a special case of emerging network models in phylogenomics. We reiterate that there is enormous promise and value in recent implementations and tests of the MSC and look forward to its increased use and refinement in phylogenomics.},

	abstract = {Abstract.—Recent advances in heuristics have made maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree estimation tractable for hundreds of sequences. Noticeably, these algorithms are currently limited to reversible models of evolution, in which Felsenstein's pulley principle applies. In this paper we show that by reorganizing the way likelihood is computed, one can efficiently compute the likelihood of a tree from any of its nodes with a nonreversible model of DNA sequence evolution, and hence benefit from cutting-edge heuristics. This computational trick can be used with reversible models of evolution without any extra cost. We then introduce nhPhyML, the adaptation of the nonhomogeneous nonstationary model of Galtier and Gouy (1998; Mol. Biol. Evol. 15:871-879) to the structure of PhyML, as well as an approximation of the model in which the set of equilibrium frequencies is limited. This new version shows good results both in terms of exploration of the space of tree topologies and ancestral G-f-C content estimation. We eventually apply it to rRNA sequences slowly evolving sites and conclude that the model and a wider taxonomic sampling still do not plead for a hyperthermophilic last universal common ancestor.

Here, we analyze alternative and more realistic Yule and birth–death models. We show how censoring at the present both makes average branches one half what we might expect and makes pendant and interior branches roughly equal in length. Although dependent on whether we condition on the size of the tree, its age, or both, these results hold both for the Yule model and for birth–death models with moderate extinction. Importantly, the rough equivalency in interior and exterior branch lengths means that the loss of evolutionary history with loss of species can be roughly linear. Under these models, the Tree of Life may offer limited redundancy in the face of ongoing species loss.},

Historically, to find a useful tree shape statistic, formulas have been invented by hand and then evaluated for utility. This paper presents the first method which is capable of optimizing over a class of tree shape statistics, called Binary Recursive Tree Shape Statistics (BRTSS). After defining the BRTSS class, a set of algebraic expressions is defined which can be used in the recursions. The set of tree shape statistics definable using these expressions in the BRTSS is very general and includes many of the statistics with which phylogenetic researchers are already familiar. We then present a practical genetic algorithm which is capable of performing optimization over BRTSS given any objective function. The chapter concludes with a successful application of the methods to find a new statistic which indicates a significant difference between two distributions on trees which were previously postulated to have similar properties.

We found that in lemurs, Alu elements show a broader and more symmetric sequence divergence distribution, suggesting a steady rate of Alu retrotransposition activity among prosimians. In contrast, Alu elements in anthropoids show a skewed distribution shifted toward more ancient elements with continual declining rates in recent Alu activity along the hominoid lineage of evolution. Using an integrated approach combining mutation profile and insertion/deletion analyses, we identified nine novel lineage-specific Alu subfamilies in lemur (seven), marmoset (one), and baboon/macaque (one) containing multiple diagnostic mutations distinct from their human counterparts-Alu J, S, and Y subfamilies, respectively. Among these primates, we show that that the lemur has the lowest density of Alu repeats (55 repeats/Mb), while marmoset has the greatest abundance (188 repeats/Mb). We estimate that approximately 70\% of lemur and 16\% of marmoset Alu elements belong to lineage-specific subfamilies. Our analysis has provided an evolutionary framework for further classification and refinement of the Alu repeat phylogeny.

A better understanding of the properties and dynamics of this network is essential for surveillance, prevention, and eventual eradication of HIV. Here, we apply a simple and computationally efficient network-based approach to all publicly available HIV polymerase sequences in the global database, revealing a contemporary picture of the spread of HIV-1 within and between countries. This approach automatically recovered well-characterized transmission clusters and extended other clusters thought to be contained within a single country across international borders. In addition, previously undescribed transmission clusters were discovered. Together, these clusters represent all known modes of HIV transmission. The extent of international linkage revealed by our comprehensive approach demonstrates the need to consider the global diversity of HIV, even when describing local epidemics. Finally, the speed of this method allows for near-real-time surveillance of the pandemic's progression.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As sequence data sets used for the investigation of pathogen transmission patterns increase in size, automated tools and standardized methods for cluster analysis have become necessary. We have developed an automated Cluster Picker which identifies monophyletic clades meeting user-input criteria for bootstrap support and maximum genetic distance within large phylogenetic trees. A second tool, the Cluster Matcher, automates the process of linking genetic data to epidemiological or clinical data, and matches clusters between runs of the Cluster Picker. RESULTS: We explore the effect of different bootstrap and genetic distance thresholds on clusters identified in a data set of publicly available HIV sequences, and compare these results to those of a previously published tool for cluster identification. To demonstrate their utility, we then use the Cluster Picker and Cluster Matcher together to investigate how clusters in the data set changed over time. We find that clusters containing sequences from more than one UK location at the first time point (multiple origin) were significantly more likely to grow than those representing only a single location. CONCLUSIONS: The Cluster Picker and Cluster Matcher can rapidly process phylogenetic trees containing tens of thousands of sequences. Together these tools will facilitate comparisons of pathogen transmission dynamics between studies and countries.},

FastTree 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better trees and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the âCATâ approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and genuine alignments, FastTree 2 is slightly more accurate than a standard implementation of maximum-likelihood NNIs (PhyML 3 with default settings). Although FastTree 2 is not quite as accurate as methods that use maximum-likelihood SPRs, most of the splits that disagree are poorly supported, and for large alignments, FastTree 2 is 100â1,000 times faster. FastTree 2 inferred a topology and likelihood-based local support values for 237,882 distinct 16S ribosomal RNAs on a desktop computer in 22 hours and 5.8 gigabytes of memory.

	abstract = {Production of massive DNA sequence datasets is transforming phylogenetic inference, but best practices for analyzing such datasets are not well established. One uncertainty is robustness to missing data, particularly in coalescent frameworks. To understand the effects of increasing matrix size and loci at the cost of increasing missing data, we produced a 90 taxon, 2.2 megabase, 4800 locus sequence matrix of landfowl using target capture of ultraconserved elements. We then compared phylogenies estimated with concatenated maximum likelihood, quartet-based methods executed on concatenated matrices, and gene tree reconciliation methods across five thresholds of missing data. Results of maximum likelihood and quartet analyses were similar, well-resolved, and demonstrated increasing support with increasing matrix size and sparseness. Conversely, gene tree reconciliation produced unexpected relationships when we included all informative loci, with certain taxa placed towards the root compared to other approaches. Inspection of these taxa identified a prevalence of short average contigs, which potentially biased gene tree inference and caused erroneous results in gene tree reconciliation. This suggests the more problematic missing data in gene-tree based analyses are partial sequences rather than entire missing sequences from locus alignments. Limiting gene tree reconciliation to the most informative loci solved this problem, producing well-supported topologies congruent with concatenation and quartet methods. Collectively, our analyses provide a well-resolved phylogeny of landfowl, including strong support for previously problematic relationships such as those among junglefowl (Gallus), and clarify the position of two enigmatic galliform genera (Lerwa, Melanoperdix) not sampled in previous molecular phylogenetic studies.

	abstract = {Many phylogenomic studies based on transcriptomes have been limited to "single-copy" genes due to methodological challenges in homology and orthology inferences. Only a relatively small number of studies have explored analyses beyond reconstructing species relationships. We sampled 69 transcriptomes in the hyperdiverse plant clade Caryophyllales and 27 outgroups from annotated genomes across eudicots. Using a combined similarity- and phylogenetic tree-based approach, we recovered 10,960 homolog groups, where each was represented by at least eight ingroup taxa. By decomposing these homolog trees, and taking gene duplications into account, we obtained 17,273 ortholog groups, where each was represented by at least ten ingroup taxa. We reconstructed the species phylogeny using a 1,122-gene data set with a gene occupancy of 92.1\%. From the homolog trees we found that both synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates in herbaceous lineages are up to three times as fast as in their woody relatives. This is the first time such a pattern has been shown across thousands of nuclear genes with dense taxon sampling. We also pinpointed regions of the Caryophyllales tree that were characterized by relatively high frequencies of gene duplication, including three previously unrecognized whole genome duplications. By further combining information from homolog tree topology and synonymous distance between paralog pairs, phylogenetic locations for 13 putative genome duplication events were identified. Genes that experienced the greatest gene family expansion were concentrated among those involved in signal transduction and oxidoreduction, including a cytochrome P450 gene that encodes a key enzyme in the betalain synthesis pathway. Our approach demonstrates a new approach for functional phylogenomic analysis in non-model species that is based on homolog groups in addition to inferred ortholog groups.},

The two current approaches to the analysis of antibody repertoires [next generation sequencing (NGS) and mass spectrometry (MS)] present difficult computational challenges since antibodies are not directly encoded in the germline but are extensively diversified by somatic recombination and hypermutations. Therefore, the protein database required for the interpretation of spectra from circulating antibodies is custom for each individual. Although such a database can be constructed via NGS, the reads generated by NGS are error-prone and even a single nucleotide error precludes identification of a peptide by the standard proteomics tools. Here, we present the IgRepertoireConstructor algorithm that performs error-correction of immunosequencing reads and uses mass spectra to validate the constructed antibody repertoires.

We falsify both of those conclusions here by demonstrating that discrepant results between the coalescent and concatenation analyses are primarily caused by the coalescent methods applied (MP-EST and STAR) not being robust to the highly divergent and often mis-rooted gene trees that were used. This result reinforces the expectation that low amounts of phylogenetic signal and methodological artifacts in gene-tree reconstruction can be more problematic for shortcut coalescent methods than is the assumption of a single hierarchy for all genes by concatenation methods when these approaches are applied to ancient divergences in empirical studies. We also demonstrate that a third coalescent method, ASTRAL, is more robust to mis-rooted gene trees than MP-EST or STAR, and that both Observed Variability (OV) and Tree Independent Generation of Evolutionary Rates (TIGER), which are two character subsampling procedures, are biased in favor of characters with highly asymmetrical distributions of character states when applied to this dataset. We conclude that enthusiastic application of novel tools is not a substitute for rigorous application of first principles, and that trending methods (e.g., shortcut coalescent methods applied to ancient divergences, tree-independent character subsampling), may be novel sources of previously under-appreciated, systematic errors.},

Based on this method, I develop a practical algorithm that takes a set of gene tree topologies and infers species trees with maximum likelihood. This algorithm searches for the best species tree by starting from initial species trees and performing heuristic search to obtain better trees with higher likelihood. This algorithm, called STELLS (which stands for Species Tree InfErence with Likelihood for Lineage Sorting), has been implemented in a program that is downloadable from the author's web page. The simulation results show that the STELLS algorithm is more accurate than an existing maximum likelihood method for many datasets, especially when there is noise in gene trees.

FSA uses its explicit statistical model to produce multiple alignments which are accompanied by estimates of the alignment accuracy and uncertainty for every column and character of the alignment--previously available only with alignment programs which use computationally-expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo approaches--yet can align thousands of long sequences. Moreover, FSA utilizes an unsupervised query-specific learning procedure for parameter estimation which leads to improved accuracy on benchmark reference alignments in comparison to existing programs.

	abstract = {We address the problem of the joint statistical inference of phylogenetic trees and multiple sequence alignments from unaligned molecular sequences. This problem is generally formulated in terms of string-valued evolutionary processes along the branches of a phylogenetic tree. The classic evolutionary process, the TKF91 model [Thorne JL, Kishino H, Felsenstein J (1991) J Mol Evol 33(2):114-124] is a continuous-time Markov chain model composed of insertion, deletion, and substitution events. Unfortunately, this model gives rise to an intractable computational problem: The computation of the marginal likelihood under the TKF91 model is exponential in the number of taxa. In this work, we present a stochastic process, the Poisson Indel Process (PIP), in which the complexity of this computation is reduced to linear. The Poisson Indel Process is closely related to the TKF91 model, differing only in its treatment of insertions, but it has a global characterization as a Poisson process on the phylogeny. Standard results for Poisson processes allow key computations to be decoupled, which yields the favorable computational profile of inference under the PIP model.

	abstract = {Our comparative study of morphological (our data on selected living primates) and molecular characters (from the literature) confirms that, overall, phylogenetic reconstructions of Primates, and consequently their classifications, are more similar than dissimilar. When data from fossil Primates are incorporated, there may be several possible relationships among living Primates; the difference between most of them hinges mainly on the position of Tarsius. In one hypothesis, tarsiers are closely related to lemurs and lorises, and thus Primates is divided into Prosimii [lorises, lemurs, and tarsiers] and Anthropoidea [Platyrrhini and Catarrhini, i.e., monkeys, apes, and humans]. Two additional alternatives are that Tarsius is a sister group to the clade embracing lorises + lemurs and Anthropoidea and that in which all three lineages (Tarsius, lorises + lemurs, and Anthropoidea) form a polychotomy. In another hypothesis, tarsiers are closely related to anthropoids, giving these two branches: Strepsirhini [lemurs, lorises] and Haplorhini [tarsiers and Anthropoidea (Platyrrhini, the New World monkeys, and Catarrhini, Old World monkeys and Hominoidea)]. The first three alternatives gain some support from the fossil record, and the fourth from morphology of the living Tarsius and molecular data. It is emphasized that the morphological characters employed in this study for Tarsius are based on the only surviving genus of once-diverse tarsiiform primates known from the Eocene, and, although considered a "living fossil," it cannot represent all of them. Furthermore, Tarsius embodies derived features of its own which may affect its systematic position, but not necessarily the position of Tarsiiformes. Although the early Tertiary adapoids might have more nearly resembled anthropoids in their biochemistry and placental developments, this hypothesis is not testable from fossils, and any inferred relationships here must be based on characters of skeletal anatomy. Alternatively, anthropoids may be derived from certain omomyids or from some as yet undiscovered Eocene African taxon. Close relationships among Homo, Pan, and Gorilla have been confirmed during recent decades; Pongo is the sister group to this trichotomy. With increasing molecular data, Homo and Pan appear to be closer to each other than to any other living hominid taxon. Gorilla is a sister group to the Homo-Pan clade and Pongo is a sister group to all of them. Morphologists have given limited evidence for such a dichotomous grouping. In this study, we support the Homo-Pan clade, although with characters not as strong as for other clades.},

Clear communication and representation of the chosen model is crucial for: (1) reproducibility of an analysis, (2) model development and (3) software design. Moreover, a unified, clear and understandable framework for model representation lowers the barrier for beginners and non-specialists to grasp complex phylogenetic models, including their assumptions and parameter/variable dependencies. Graphical modeling is a unifying framework that has gained in popularity in the statistical literature in recent years. The core idea is to break complex models into conditionally independent distributions. The strength lies in the comprehensibility, flexibility, and adaptability of this formalism, and the large body of computational work based on it. Graphical models are well-suited to teach statistical models, to facilitate communication among phylogeneticists and in the development of generic software for simulation and statistical inference. Here, we provide an introduction to graphical models for phylogeneticists and extend the standard graphical model representation to the realm of phylogenetics. We introduce a new graphical model component, tree plates, to capture the changing structure of the subgraph corresponding to a phylogenetic tree. We describe a range of phylogenetic models using the graphical model framework and introduce modules to simplify the representation of standard components in large and complex models. Phylogenetic model graphs can be readily used in simulation, maximum likelihood inference, and Bayesian inference using, for example, Metropolis-Hastings or Gibbs sampling of the posterior distribution.},

We conclude that about 1/3 of our genes started to evolve as human-specific lineages before the differentiation of human, chimps, and gorillas took place. This explains recurrent findings of very old human-specific morphological traits in the fossils record, which predate the recent emergence of the human species about 5-6 MYA.

If the gene is defined in a historical (coalescent) sense, there can be multiple gene trees within the single contiguous set of nucleotides, and attempts to construct a single tree for such a sequence must deal with homoplasy created by conflict among divergent histories. On a larger scale, incongruence is expected among gene tree topologies at different loci of individuals within sexually reproducing species, and it has been suggested that this discordance can be used to delimit species. A practical concern for such topological methods is that polymorphisms may be maintained through numerous cladogenic events; this polymorphism problem is less of a concern for nontopological approaches to species delimitation using molecular data. Although a central theoretical concern in molecular systematics is discordance between a given gene tree and the true "species tree," the primary empirical problem faced in reconstructing taxic phylogeny is incongruence among the trees inferred from different sequences. Linkage relationships limit character independence and thus have important implications for handling multiple data sets in phylogenetic analysis, particularly at the species level, where incongruence among different historically associated loci is expected. Gene trees can also be reconstructed for loci that influence phenotypic characters, but there is at best a tenuous relationship between phenotypic homoplasy and homoplasy in such gene trees. Nevertheless, expression patterns and orthology relationships of genes involved in the expression of phenotypes can in theory provide criteria for homology assessment of morphological characters.},

	abstract = {Large datasets that include many taxa and many genes are required to solve difficult phylogenetic problems that are deep in the Tree of Life. Currently, two divergent systematic methods are applicable and commonly applied to such datasets: the traditional supermatrix approach (= concatenation) and "shortcut" coalescence methods (= coalescence methods wherein gene trees and the species tree are not co-estimated). When applied to ancient clades, these contrasting frameworks often produce congruent results, but in recent phylogenetic analyses of Placentalia (placental mammals), this is not the case, with proponents of coalescence arguing that their novel approach robustly supports several interordinal clades that have resisted consistent resolution using standard concatenation methods. A recent series of papers has alternatively disputed and defended the utility of shortcut coalescence methods at deep phylogenetic scales (Meredith et al., 2011; Song et al., 2012; Gatesy and Springer, 2013; Wu et al., 2013; Zhong et al., 2013, 2014; Springer and Gatesy, 2014). Here, we examine this exchange in the context of published phylogenomic data from Mammalia (183 loci; McCormack et al., 2012); in particular we explore two critical and related issues - the delimitation of data partitions ("genes") in coalescence analysis and hidden support that emerges with the combination of such partitions in phylogenetic studies. Hidden support - increased support for a clade in combined analysis of all data partitions relative to the support evident in separate analyses of the various data partitions, is a hallmark of the supermatrix approach and a primary rationale for concatenating all characters into a single matrix. In the most extreme cases of hidden support, relationships that are contradicted by all gene trees are supported when all of the genes are analyzed together. A valid fear is that shortcut coalescence methods might bypass or distort character support that is hidden in individual loci because small gene fragments are analyzed in isolation. Given the extensive database of molecular, phenotypic, and fossil data for Mammalia, the assumptions and applicability of shortcut coalescence methods can be assessed with rigor to complement a small but growing body of simulation work that has directly compared these methods to concatenation. We document several remarkable cases of hidden support in both supermatrix and coalescence paradigms and argue that in most instances, the emergent support in the shortcut coalescence analyses is an artifact. By referencing rigorous molecular clock studies of Mammalia, we suggest that inaccurate gene trees that imply unrealistically deep coalescences debilitate shortcut coalescence analyses of the placental dataset. We document contradictory coalescence results for Placentalia, and outline a critical conundrum that challenges the general utility of shortcut coalescence methods at deep phylogenetic scales. In particular, the basic unit of analysis in coalescence analysis, the coalescence-gene (a minimal non-recombining stretch of aligned genomes) is expected to shrink in size as more taxa are analyzed, but as the amount of data for reconstruction of a gene tree ratchets downward, the number of nodes in the gene tree that need to be resolved ratchets upward. One possible solution to this inevitable equation is to concatenate multiple coalescence-genes to yield "gene trees" that better match the species tree. However, this hybrid concatenation/coalescence approach, "concatalescence," contradicts the most basic biological rationale for performing a coalescence analysis in the first place. We discuss this reality in the context of recent simulation work that also suggests inaccurate reconstruction of gene trees is more problematic for shortcut coalescence methods than deep coalescence of independently segregating loci is for concatenation methods.},

Here we explore approaches to phylogenetic inference designed to consider retention and sorting of ancestral polymorphism. We examine how the reconstructability of a species (or population) phylogeny is affected by (a) the number of loci used to estimate the phylogeny and (b) the number of individuals sampled per species. Even in difficult cases with considerable incomplete lineage sorting (times between divergences less than 1 N(e) generations), we found the reconstructed species trees matched the "true" species trees in at least three out of five partitions, as long as a reasonable number of individuals per species were sampled. We also studied the tradeoff between sampling more loci versus more individuals. Although increasing the number of loci gives more accurate trees for a given sampling effort with deeper species trees (e.g., total depth of 10 N(e) generations), sampling more individuals often gives better results than sampling more loci with shallower species trees (e.g., depth = 1 N(e)). Taken together, these results demonstrate that gene sequences retain enough signal to achieve an accurate estimate of phylogeny despite widespread incomplete lineage sorting. Continued improvement in our methods to reconstruct phylogeny near the species level will require a shift to a compound model that considers not only nucleotide or character state substitutions, but also the population genetics processes of lineage sorting.

	abstract = {With the increasing interest in recognizing the discordance between gene genealogies, various gene tree/species tree reconciliation methods have been developed. We present here the first attempt to assess and compare two such Bayesian methods, Bayesian estimation of species trees (BEST) and BUCKy (Bayesian untangling of concordance knots), in the presence of several known processes of gene tree discordance. DNA alignments were simulated under the influence of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and of horizontal gene transfer (HGT). BEST and BUCKy both account for uncertainty in gene tree estimation but differ substantially in their assumptions of what caused gene tree discordance. BEST estimates a species tree using the coalescent model, assuming that all gene tree discordance is due to ILS. BUCKy does not assume any specific biological process of gene tree discordance through the use of a nonparametric clustering of concordant genes. BUCKy estimates the concordance factor (CF) of a clade, which is defined as the proportion of genes that truly have the clade in their trees. The estimated concordance tree is then built from clades with the highest estimated CFs. Because of their different assumptions, it was expected that BEST would perform better in the presence of ILS and that BUCKy would perform better in the presence of HGT. As expected, the species tree was more accurately reconstructed by BUCKy in the presence of HGT, when the HGT events were unevenly placed across the species tree. BUCKy and BEST performed similarly in most other cases, including in the presence of strong ILS and of HGT events that were evenly placed across the tree. However, BUCKy was shown to underestimate the uncertainty in CF estimation, with short credibility intervals. Despite this, the discordance pattern estimated by BUCKy could be compared with the signature of ILS. The resulting test for the adequacy of the coalescent model proved to have low Type I error. It was powerful when HGT was the major source of discordance and when HGT events were unevenly placed across the species tree.},

	abstract = {Numerous simulation studies have investigated the accuracy of phylogenetic inference of gene trees under maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian techniques. The relative accuracy of species tree inference methods under simulation has received less study. The number of analytical techniques available for inferring species trees is increasing rapidly, and in this paper, we compare the performance of several species tree inference techniques at estimating recent species divergences using computer simulation. Simulating gene trees within species trees of different shapes and with varying tree lengths (T) and population sizes (), and evolving sequences on those gene trees, allows us to determine how phylogenetic accuracy changes in relation to different levels of deep coalescence and phylogenetic signal. When the probability of discordance between the gene trees and the species tree is high (i.e., T is small and/or is large), Bayesian species tree inference using the multispecies coalescent (BEST) outperforms other methods. The performance of all methods improves as the total length of the species tree is increased, which reflects the combined benefits of decreasing the probability of discordance between species trees and gene trees and gaining more accurate estimates for gene trees. Decreasing the probability of deep coalescences by reducing also leads to accuracy gains for most methods. Increasing the number of loci from 10 to 100 improves accuracy under difficult demographic scenarios (i.e., coalescent units ≤ 4N(e)), but 10 loci are adequate for estimating the correct species tree in cases where deep coalescence is limited or absent. In general, the correlation between the phylogenetic accuracy and the posterior probability values obtained from BEST is high, although posterior probabilities are overestimated when the prior distribution for is misspecified.},

	abstract = {The estimation of species trees (phylogenies) is one of the most important problems in evolutionary biology, and recently, there has been greater appreciation of the need to estimate species trees directly rather than using gene trees as a surrogate. A Bayesian method constructed under the multispecies coalescent model can consistently estimate species trees but involves intensive computation, which can hinder its application to the phylogenetic analysis of large-scale genomic data. Many summary statisticsâ€“based approaches, such as shallowest coalescences (SC) and Global LAteSt Split (GLASS), have been developed to infer species phylogenies for multilocus data sets. In this paper, we propose 2 methods, species tree estimation using average ranks of coalescences (STAR) and species tree estimation using average coalescence times (STEAC), based on the summary statistics of coalescence times. It can be shown that the 2 methods are statistically consistent under the multispecies coalescent model. STAR uses the ranks of coalescences and is thus resistant to variable substitution rates along the branches in gene trees. A simulation study suggests that STAR consistently outperforms STEAC, SC, and GLASS when the substitution rates among lineages are highly variable. Two real genomic data sets were analyzed by the 2 methods and produced species trees that are consistent with previous results.},

The gene duplication and loss process is a major cause for incongruence between gene and species tree, and deterministic methods have been developed to explain such differences through tree reconciliations. Although probabilistic methods for phylogenetic inference have been around for decades, probabilistic reconciliation methods are far less established. Based on our model, we have implemented a Bayesian analysis tool, PrIME-GSR, for gene tree inference that takes a known species tree into account. Our implementation is sound and we demonstrate its utility for genomewide gene-family analysis by applying it to recently presented yeast data. We validate PrIME-GSR by comparing with previous analyses of these data that take advantage of gene order information. In a case study we apply our method to the ADH gene family and are able to draw biologically relevant conclusions concerning gene duplications creating key yeast phenotypes. On a higher level this shows the biological relevance of our method. The obtained results demonstrate the value of a relaxed molecular clock. Our good performance will extend to species where gene order conservation is insufficient.},

The commonly used method for estimating ancestral population sizes, based on counting mismatches between the species tree and the inferred gene trees, is highly biased as it ignores uncertainties in gene tree reconstruction. In this article, we develop a Bayes method for simultaneous estimation of the species divergence times and current and ancestral population sizes. The method uses DNA sequence data from multiple loci and extracts information about conflicts among gene tree topologies and coalescent times to estimate ancestral population sizes. The topology of the species tree is assumed known. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is implemented to integrate over uncertain gene trees and branch lengths (or coalescence times) at each locus as well as species divergence times. The method can handle any species tree and allows different numbers of sequences at different loci. We apply the method to published noncoding DNA sequences from the human and the great apes. There are strong correlations between posterior estimates of speciation times and ancestral population sizes. With the use of an informative prior for the human-chimpanzee divergence date, the population size of the common ancestor of the two species is estimated to be approximately 20,000, with a 95\% credibility interval (8000, 40,000). Our estimates, however, are affected by model assumptions as well as data quality. We suggest that reliable estimates have yet to await more data and more realistic models.},

Our results suggest that data sets consisting of single or a small number of concatenated genes have a significant probability of supporting conflicting topologies. By contrast, analyses of the entire data set of concatenated genes yielded a single, fully resolved species tree with maximum support. Comparable results were obtained with a concatenation of a minimum of 20 genes; substantially more genes than commonly used but a small fraction of any genome.

	abstract = {Multigene sequence data have great potential for elucidating important and interesting evolutionary processes, but statistical methods for extracting information from such data remain limited. Although various biological processes may cause different genes to have different genealogical histories (and hence different tree topologies), we also may expect that the number of distinct topologies among a set of genes is relatively small compared with the number of possible topologies. Therefore evidence about the tree topology for one gene should influence our inferences of the tree topology on a different gene, but to what extent? In this paper, we present a new approach for modeling and estimating concordance among a set of gene trees given aligned molecular sequence data. Our approach introduces a one-parameter probability distribution to describe the prior distribution of concordance among gene trees. We describe a novel 2-stage Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method that first obtains independent Bayesian posterior probability distributions for individual genes using standard methods. These posterior distributions are then used as input for a second MCMC procedure that estimates a posterior distribution of gene-to-tree maps (GTMs). The posterior distribution of GTMs can then be summarized to provide revised posterior probability distributions for each gene (taking account of concordance) and to allow estimation of the proportion of the sampled genes for which any given clade is true (the sample-wide concordance factor). Further, under the assumption that the sampled genes are drawn randomly from a genome of known size, we show how one can obtain an estimate, with credibility intervals, on the proportion of the entire genome for which a clade is true (the genome-wide concordance factor). We demonstrate the method on a set of 106 genes from 8 yeast species.},

This counterintuitive result implies that in combining data on multiple loci, the straightforward procedure of using the most frequently observed gene tree topology as an estimate of the species tree topology can be asymptotically guaranteed to produce an incorrect estimate.

	abstract = {Highly accurate estimation of phylogenetic trees for large data sets is difficult, in part because multiple sequence alignments must be accurate for phylogeny estimation methods to be accurate. Coestimation of alignments and trees has been attempted but currently only SATé estimates reasonably accurate trees and alignments for large data sets in practical time frames (Liu K., Raghavan S., Nelesen S., Linder C.R., Warnow T. 2009b. Rapid and accurate large-scale coestimation of sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees. Science. 324:1561-1564). Here, we present a modification to the original SATé algorithm that improves upon SATé (which we now call SATé-I) in terms of speed and of phylogenetic and alignment accuracy. SATé-II uses a different divide-and-conquer strategy than SATé-I and so produces smaller more closely related subsets than SATé-I; as a result, SATé-II produces more accurate alignments and trees, can analyze larger data sets, and runs more efficiently than SATé-I. Generally, SATé is a metamethod that takes an existing multiple sequence alignment method as an input parameter and boosts the quality of that alignment method. SATé-II-boosted alignment methods are significantly more accurate than their unboosted versions, and trees based upon these improved alignments are more accurate than trees based upon the original alignments. Because SATé-I used maximum likelihood (ML) methods that treat gaps as missing data to estimate trees and because we found a correlation between the quality of tree/alignment pairs and ML scores, we explored the degree to which SATé's performance depends on using ML with gaps treated as missing data to determine the best tree/alignment pair. We present two lines of evidence that using ML with gaps treated as missing data to optimize the alignment and tree produces very poor results. First, we show that the optimization problem where a set of unaligned DNA sequences is given and the output is the tree and alignment of those sequences that maximize likelihood under the Jukes-Cantor model is uninformative in the worst possible sense. For all inputs, all trees optimize the likelihood score. Second, we show that a greedy heuristic that uses GTR+Gamma ML to optimize the alignment and the tree can produce very poor alignments and trees. Therefore, the excellent performance of SATé-II and SATé-I is not because ML is used as an optimization criterion for choosing the best tree/alignment pair but rather due to the particular divide-and-conquer realignment techniques employed.},

	abstract = {Several authors have argued recently that extensive taxon sampling has a positive and important effect on the accuracy of phylogenetic estimates. However, other authors have argued that there is little benefit of extensive taxon sampling, and so phylogenetic problems can or should be reduced to a few exemplar taxa as a means of reducing the computational complexity of the phylogenetic analysis. In this paper we examined five aspects of study design that may have led to these different perspectives. First, we considered the measurement of phylogenetic error across a wide range of taxon sample sizes, and conclude that the expected error based on randomly selecting trees (which varies by taxon sample size) must be considered in evaluating error in studies of the effects of taxon sampling. Second, we addressed the scope of the phylogenetic problems defined by different samples of taxa, and argue that phylogenetic scope needs to be considered in evaluating the importance of taxon-sampling strategies. Third, we examined the claim that fast and simple tree searches are as effective as more thorough searches at finding near-optimal trees that minimize error. We show that a more complete search of tree space reduces phylogenetic error, especially as the taxon sample size increases. Fourth, we examined the effects of simple versus complex simulation models on taxonomic sampling studies. Although benefits of taxon sampling are apparent for all models, data generated under more complex models of evolution produce higher overall levels of error and show greater positive effects of increased taxon sampling. Fifth, we asked if different phylogenetic optimality criteria show different effects of taxon sampling. Although we found strong differences in effectiveness of different optimality criteria as a function of taxon sample size, increased taxon sampling improved the results from all the common optimality criteria. Nonetheless, the method that showed the lowest overall performance (minimum evolution) also showed the least improvement from increased taxon sampling. Taking each of these results into account re-enforces the conclusion that increased sampling of taxa is one of the most important ways to increase overall phylogenetic accuracy.},

By contrast, the use of different tree reconstruction methods on different partitions of the concatenated supergene leads to well-resolved, but real (i.e. statistically significant) incongruences. Gathering a large amount of data is not sufficient to produce reliable trees, given the current limitation of tree reconstruction methods, especially when the quality of data is poor.

	abstract = {PhyML is a phylogeny software based on the maximum-likelihood principle. Early PhyML versions used a fast algorithm performing nearest neighbor interchanges to improve a reasonable starting tree topology. Since the original publication (Guindon S., Gascuel O. 2003. A simple, fast and accurate algorithm to estimate large phylogenies by maximum likelihood. Syst. Biol. 52:696–704), PhyML has been widely used ({\textgreater}2500 citations in ISI Web of Science) because of its simplicity and a fair compromise between accuracy and speed. In the meantime, research around PhyML has continued, and this article describes the new algorithms and methods implemented in the program. First, we introduce a new algorithm to search the tree space with user-defined intensity using subtree pruning and regrafting topological moves. The parsimony criterion is used here to filter out the least promising topology modifications with respect to the likelihood function. The analysis of a large collection of real nucleotide and amino acid data sets of various sizes demonstrates the good performance of this method. Second, we describe a new test to assess the support of the data for internal branches of a phylogeny. This approach extends the recently proposed approximate likelihood-ratio test and relies on a nonparametric, Shimodaira–Hasegawa–like procedure. A detailed analysis of real alignments sheds light on the links between this new approach and the more classical nonparametric bootstrap method. Overall, our tests show that the last version (3.0) of PhyML is fast, accurate, stable, and ready to use. A Web server and binary files are available from http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/.},

Yet, gene trees often differ from species trees, creating challenges to species tree estimation. One of the most frequent causes for conflicting topologies between gene trees and species trees is incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), which is modelled by the multi-species coalescent. While many methods have been developed to estimate species trees from multiple genes, some which have statistical guarantees under the multi-species coalescent model, existing methods are too computationally intensive for use with genome-scale analyses or have been shown to have poor accuracy under some realistic conditions.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: We present ASTRAL, a fast method for estimating species trees from multiple genes. ASTRAL is statistically consistent, can run on datasets with thousands of genes and has outstanding accuracy-improving on MP-EST and the population tree from BUCKy, two statistically consistent leading coalescent-based methods. ASTRAL is often more accurate than concatenation using maximum likelihood, except when ILS levels are low or there are too few gene trees.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: ASTRAL is available in open source form at https://github.com/smirarab/ASTRAL/.

	abstract = {SignificanceEarly branching events in the diversification of land plants and closely related algal lineages remain fundamental and unresolved questions in plant evolutionary biology. Accurate reconstructions of these relationships are critical for testing hypotheses of character evolution: for example, the origins of the embryo, vascular tissue, seeds, and flowers. We investigated relationships among streptophyte algae and land plants using the largest set of nuclear genes that has been applied to this problem to date. Hypothesized relationships were rigorously tested through a series of analyses to assess systematic errors in phylogenetic inference caused by sampling artifacts and model misspecification. Results support some generally accepted phylogenetic hypotheses, while rejecting others. This work provides a new framework for studies of land plant evolution. Reconstructing the origin and evolution of land plants and their algal relatives is a fundamental problem in plant phylogenetics, and is essential for understanding how critical adaptations arose, including the embryo, vascular tissue, seeds, and flowers. Despite advances in molecular systematics, some hypotheses of relationships remain weakly resolved. Inferring deep phylogenies with bouts of rapid diversification can be problematic; however, genome-scale data should significantly increase the number of informative characters for analyses. Recent phylogenomic reconstructions focused on the major divergences of plants have resulted in promising but inconsistent results. One limitation is sparse taxon sampling, likely resulting from the difficulty and cost of data generation. To address this limitation, transcriptome data for 92 streptophyte taxa were generated and analyzed along with 11 published plant genome sequences. Phylogenetic reconstructions were conducted using up to 852 nuclear genes and 1,701,170 aligned sites. Sixty-nine analyses were performed to test the robustness of phylogenetic inferences to permutations of the data matrix or to phylogenetic method, including supermatrix, supertree, and coalescent-based approaches, maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods, partitioned and unpartitioned analyses, and amino acid versus DNA alignments. Among other results, we find robust support for a sister-group relationship between land plants and one group of streptophyte green algae, the Zygnematophyceae. Strong and robust support for a clade comprising liverworts and mosses is inconsistent with a widely accepted view of early land plant evolution, and suggests that phylogenetic hypotheses used to understand the evolution of fundamental plant traits should be reevaluated.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Species tree estimation can be challenging in the presence of gene tree conflict due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), which can occur when the time between speciation events is short relative to the population size. Of the many methods that have been developed to estimate species trees in the presence of ILS, *BEAST, a Bayesian method that co-estimates the species tree and gene trees given sequence alignments on multiple loci, has generally been shown to have the best accuracy. However, *BEAST is extremely computationally intensive so that it cannot be used with large numbers of loci; hence, *BEAST is not suitable for genome-scale analyses.

RESULTS: We present BBCA (boosted binned coalescent-based analysis), a method that can be used with *BEAST (and other such co-estimation methods) to improve scalability. BBCA partitions the loci randomly into subsets, uses *BEAST on each subset to co-estimate the gene trees and species tree for the subset, and then combines the newly estimated gene trees together using MP-EST, a popular coalescent-based summary method. We compare time-restricted versions of BBCA and *BEAST on simulated datasets, and show that BBCA is at least as accurate as *BEAST, and achieves better convergence rates for large numbers of loci.

CONCLUSIONS: Phylogenomic analysis using *BEAST is currently limited to datasets with a small number of loci, and analyses with even just 100 loci can be computationally challenging. BBCA uses a very simple divide-and-conquer approach that makes it possible to use *BEAST on datasets containing hundreds of loci. This study shows that BBCA provides excellent accuracy and is highly scalable.},

Different alignments on the same set of unaligned sequences are often compared, sometimes in order to assess the accuracy of alignment methods or to infer a consensus alignment from a set of estimated alignments. Three of the standard techniques for comparing alignments, Developer, Modeler and Total Column (TC) scores can be derived through calculations of the set of homologies that the alignments share. However, the brute-force technique for calculating this set is quadratic in the input size. The remaining standard technique, Cline Shift Score, inherently requires quadratic time.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: In this article, we prove that each of these scores can be computed in linear time, and we present FastSP, a linear-time algorithm for calculating these scores. Even on the largest alignments we explored (one with 50 000 sequences), FastSP completed {\textless}2 min and used at most 2 GB of the main memory. The best alternative is qscore, a method whose empirical running time is approximately the same as FastSP when given sufficient memory (at least 8 GB), but whose asymptotic running time has never been theoretically established. In addition, for comparisons of large alignments under lower memory conditions (at most 4 GB of main memory), qscore uses substantial memory (up to 10 GB for the datasets we studied), took more time and failed to analyze the largest datasets.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nAVAILABILITY: The open-source software and executables are available online at http://www.cs.utexas.edu/{\textasciitilde}phylo/software/fastsp/.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONTACT: tandy@cs.utexas.edu.},

	abstract = {Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis, is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi. Once known as an endemic health problem of poor rural populations in Latin American countries, it has now spread worldwide. The parasite is transmitted by triatomine bugs, of which Rhodnius prolixus (Hemiptera, Reduviidae, Triatominae) is one of the vectors and a model organism. This species occurs mainly in Central and South American countries where the disease is endemic. Disease prevention focuses on vector control programs that, in general, rely intensely on insecticide use. However, the massive use of chemical insecticides can lead to resistance. One of the major mechanisms is known as metabolic resistance that is associated with an increase in the expression or activity of detoxification genes. Three of the enzyme families that are involved in this process - carboxylesterases (CCE), glutathione s-transferases (GST) and cytochrome P450s (CYP) - are analyzed in the R. prolixus genome. A similar set of detoxification genes to those of the Hemipteran Acyrthosiphon pisum but smaller than in most dipteran species was found in R. prolixus genome. All major CCE classes (43 genes found) are present but the pheromone/hormone processing class had fewer genes than usual. One main expansion was detected on the detoxification/dietary class. The phosphotriesterase family, recently associated with insecticide resistance, was also represented with one gene. One microsomal GST gene was found and the cytosolic GST gene count (14 genes) is extremely low when compared to the other hemipteran species with sequenced genomes. However, this is similar to Apis mellifera, a species known for its deficit in detoxification genes. In R. prolixus 88 CYP genes were found, with representatives in the four clans (CYP2, CYP3, CYP4 and mitochondrial) usually found in insects. R. prolixus seems to have smaller species-specific expansions of CYP genes than mosquitoes and beetles, among others. The number of R. prolixus CYP genes is similar to the hemipteran Ac. pisum, although with a bigger expansion in CYP3 and CYP4 clans, along with several gene fragments, mostly in CYP4 clan. Eleven founding members of new families were detected, consisting of ten genes in the CYP3 clan and 1 gene in the CYP4 clan. Members of these clans were proposed to have important detoxification roles in insects. The identification of CCE, GST and CYP genes is of utmost importance for directing detoxification studies on triatomines that can help insecticide management strategies in control programs.},

	abstract = {Orthology analysis aims at identifying orthologous genes and gene products from different organisms and, therefore, is a powerful tool in modern computational and experimental biology. Although reconciliation-based orthology methods are generally considered more accurate than distance-based ones, the traditional parsimony-based implementation of reconciliation-based orthology analysis (most parsimonious reconciliation [MPR]) suffers from a number of shortcomings. For example, 1) it is limited to orthology predictions from the reconciliation that minimizes the number of gene duplication and loss events, 2) it cannot evaluate the support of this reconciliation in relation to the other reconciliations, and 3) it cannot make use of prior knowledge (e.g., about species divergence times) that provides auxiliary information for orthology predictions. We present a probabilistic approach to reconciliation-based orthology analysis that addresses all these issues by estimating orthology probabilities. The method is based on the gene evolution model, an explicit evolutionary model for gene duplication and gene loss inside a species tree, that generalizes the standard birth–death process. We describe the probabilistic approach to orthology analysis using 2 experimental data sets and show that the use of orthology probabilities allows a more informative analysis than MPR and, in particular, that it is less sensitive to taxon sampling problems. We generalize these anecdotal observations and show, using data generated under biologically realistic conditions, that MPR give false orthology predictions at a substantial frequency. Last, we provide a new orthology prediction method that allows an orthology and paralogy classification with any chosen sensitivity/specificity combination from the spectra of achievable combinations. We conclude that probabilistic orthology analysis is a strong and more advanced alternative to traditional orthology analysis and that it provides a framework for sophisticated comparative studies of processes in genome evolution.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Supertree methods combine trees on subsets of the full taxon set together to produce a tree on the entire set of taxa. Of the many supertree methods, the most popular is MRP (Matrix Representation with Parsimony), a method that operates by first encoding the input set of source trees by a large matrix (the "MRP matrix") over \{0,1,?\}, and then running maximum parsimony heuristics on the MRP matrix. Experimental studies evaluating MRP in comparison to other supertree methods have established that for large datasets, MRP generally produces trees of equal or greater accuracy than other methods, and can run on larger datasets. A recent development in supertree methods is SuperFine+MRP, a method that combines MRP with a divide-and-conquer approach, and produces more accurate trees in less time than MRP. In this paper we consider a new approach for supertree estimation, called MRL (Matrix Representation with Likelihood). MRL begins with the same MRP matrix, but then analyzes the MRP matrix using heuristics (such as RAxML) for 2-state Maximum Likelihood. RESULTS: We compared MRP and SuperFine+MRP with MRL and SuperFine+MRL on simulated and biological datasets. We examined the MRP and MRL scores of each method on a wide range of datasets, as well as the resulting topological accuracy of the trees. Our experimental results show that MRL, coupled with a very good ML heuristic such as RAxML, produced more accurate trees than MRP, and MRL scores were more strongly correlated with topological accuracy than MRP scores. CONCLUSIONS: SuperFine+MRP when based upon a good MRP heuristic such as TNT, produces among the best scores for both MRP and MRL, and is generally faster and more topologically accurate than other supertree methods we tested.},

This discord can arise from horizontal transfer (including hybridization), lineage sorting, and gene duplication and extinction. Lineage sorting could also be called deep coalescence, the failure of ancestral copies to coalesce (looking backwards in time) into a common ancestral copy until deeper than previous speciation events. These events depend on various factors; for instance, deep coalescence is more likely if the branches of the species tree are short (in generations) and wide (in population size). A similar dependence on process is found in historical biogeography and host-parasite relationships. Each of the processes of discord could yield a different parsimony criterion for reconstructing the species tree from a set of gene trees: with horizontal transfer, choose the species tree that minimizes the number of transfer events; with deep coalescence, choose the tree minimizing the number of extra gene lineages that had to coexist along species lineages; with gene duplication, choose the tree minimizing duplication and/or extinction events. Maximum likelihood methods for reconstructing the species tree are also possible because coalescence theory provides the probability that a particular gene tree would occur given a species tree (with branch lengths and widths specified). In considering these issues, one is provoked to reconsider precisely what is phylogeny. Perhaps it is misleading to view some gene trees as agreeing and other gene trees as disagreeing with the species tree; rather, all of the gene trees are part of the species tree, which can be visualized like a fuzzy statistical distribution, a cloud of gene histories. Alternatively, phylogeny might be (and has been) viewed not as a history of what happened, genetically, but as a history of what could have happened, i.e., a history of changes in the probabilities of inter-breeding.},

By incorporating hundreds to thousands of unlinked loci, phylogenomic analyses have the potential to mitigate these difficulties. Here, we attempt to resolve phylogenetic relationships among eight shrew species (genus Crocidura) from the Philippines, a phylogenetic problem that has proven intractable with small (\&lt; 10 loci) data sets. We sequenced hundreds of ultraconserved elements and whole mitochondrial genomes in these species and estimated phylogenies using concatenation, summary coalescent, and hierarchical coalescent methods. The concatenated approach recovered a maximally supported and fully resolved tree. In contrast, the coalescent-based approaches produced similar topologies, but each had several poorly supported nodes. Using simulations, we demonstrate that the concatenated tree could be positively misleading. Our simulations also show that the tree shape we tend to infer, which involves a series of short internal branches, is difficult to resolve, even if substitution models are known and multiple individuals per species are sampled. As such, the low support we obtained for backbone relationships in our coalescent-based inferences reflects a real and appropriate lack of certainty. Our results illuminate the challenges of estimating a bifurcating tree in a rapid and recent radiation, providing a rare empirical example of a nearly simultaneous series of speciation events in a terrestrial animal lineage as it spreads across an oceanic archipelago.},

	abstract = {With the proliferation of species-tree methods, empiricists now have to confront the daunting task of method choice. Such decisions might be made based on theoretical considerations alone. However, the messiness of real data means that theoretical ideals may not hold in practice (e.g., with convergence of complicated MCMC algorithms and computational times that limit analyses to small data sets). On the other hand, simplifying assumptions made by some approaches may compromise the accuracy of species-tree estimates. Here we examine the purported tradeoff between accuracy and computational simplicity for species-tree analysis, focusing on the different ways the approaches treat gene-tree uncertainty. By considering a diversity of species trees, as well as different sampling designs and total sampling efforts, we not only compare the accuracy of species-tree estimates across methods, but we also partition the variation in accuracy across factors to identify their relative importance. This analysis shows that although the method of analysis affects accuracy, other factors - namely, the history of species divergence and aspects of the sampling design - have a larger impact. Despite a full modeling of gene tree uncertainty (e.g., using a Bayesian framework), species-tree estimates may not be accurate, particularly for recent diversification histories. Nevertheless, we demonstrate how factors within the control of the empirical investigator (e.g., decisions about sampling) improve the accuracy of species tree estimates, and more so than the method of analysis. Lastly, with much of the attention on species-tree analyses focused on the discord among loci arising from the coalescent, this work also highlights a previously overlooked key determinant of species-tree accuracy for recent divergences - the level of genetic variation at a locus, which has important implications for improving species-tree estimates in practice. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

analyses of biological data sets, estimated gene trees may differ
from true gene trees, be incompletely resolved, and not necessarily
rooted. In this article, we propose new MDC formulations for the
cases where the gene trees are unrooted/binary, rooted/non-binary,
and unrooted/non-binary. Further, we prove structural theorems that
allow us to extend the algorithms for the rooted/binary gene tree

devise MDC-based algorithms for cases when multiple alleles per species

In this essay I argue that to better deal with the large multilocus datasets brought on by phylogenomics, and to better align the fields of phylogeography and phylogenetics, we should embrace the primacy of species trees, not only as a new and useful practical tool for systematics, but also as a long-standing conceptual goal of systematics that, largely due to the lack of appropriate computational tools, has been eclipsed in the past few decades. I suggest that phylogenies as gene trees are a "local optimum" for systematics, and review recent advances that will bring us to the broader optimum inherent in species trees. In addition to adopting new methods of phylogenetic analysis (and ideally reserving the term "phylogeny" for species trees rather than gene trees), the new paradigm suggests shifts in a number of practices, such as sampling data to maximize not only the number of accumulated sites but also the number of independently segregating genes; routinely using coalescent or other models in computer simulations to allow gene tree heterogeneity; and understanding better the role of concatenation in influencing topologies and confidence in phylogenies. By building on the foundation laid by concepts of gene trees and coalescent theory, and by taking cues from recent trends in multilocus phylogeography, molecular systematics stands to be enriched. Many of the challenges and lessons learned for estimating gene trees will carry over to the challenge of estimating species trees, although adopting the species tree paradigm will clarify many issues (such as the nature of polytomies and the star tree paradox), raise conceptually new challenges, or provide new answers to old questions.},

Modern taxonomists often prefer to represent relationships between species via phylogenetic trees; the counterpart to Yule's observation is that actual reconstructed trees look surprisingly unbalanced. The imbalance can readily be seen via a scatter diagram of the sizes of clades involved in the splits of published large phylogenetic trees. Attempting stochastic modeling leads to two puzzles. First, two somewhat opposite possible biological descriptions of what dominates the macroevolutionary process (adaptive radiation; "neutral" evolution) lead to exactly the same mathematical model (Markov or Yule or coalescent). Second, neither this nor any other simple stochastic model predicts the observed pattern of imbalance. This essay represents a probabilist's musings on these puzzles, complementing the more detailed survey of biological literature by Mooers and Heard, Quart. Rev. Biol. 72 [(1997) 31-54].},

We present a novel solution to this challenge using leukemic cells with known mutational spectra as a tractable model.

	abstract = {Recent years have seen a growth in numerical studies using the comparative method. The method usually involves a comparison of two phenotypes across a range of species or higher taxa, or a comparison of one phenotype with an environmental variable. Objectives of such studies vary, and include assessing whether one variable is correlated with another and assessing whether the regres-sion of one variable on another differs significantly from some expected value. Notable recent studies using statistical methods of this type include Pilbeam and Gould's (1974) regressions of tooth area on several size measurements in mam-mals; Sherman's (1979) test of the relation between insect chromosome numbers and social behavior; Damuth's (1981) investigation of population density and body size in mammals; Martin's (1981) regression of brain weight in mammals on body weight; Givnish's (1982) examination of traits associated with dioecy across the families of angiosperms; and Armstrong's (1983) regressions of brain weight on body weight and basal metabolism rate in mammals. My intention is to point out a serious statistical problem with this approach, a problem that affects all of these studies. It arises from the fact that species are part of a hierarchically structured phylogeny, and thus cannot be regarded for statisti-cal purposes as if drawn independently from the same distribution. This problem has been noticed before, and previous suggestions of ways of coping with it are briefly discussed. The nonindependence can be circumvented in principle if ade-quate information on the phylogeny is available. The information needed to do so and the limitations on its use will be discussed. The problem will be discussed and illustrated with reference to continuous variables, but the same statistical issues arise when one or both of the variables are discrete, in which case the statistical methods involve contingency tables rather than regressions and correlations. THE PROBLEM Suppose that we have examined eight species and wish to know whether their brain size (Y) is proportional to their body size (X). We may wish to test whether the slope of the regression of Y on X (or preferably of log Y on log X) is unity. Figure 1 shows a scatter diagram of hypothetical data. It is tempting to simply do},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Accurately modeling the sequence substitution process is required for the correct estimation of evolutionary parameters, be they phylogenetic relationships, substitution rates or ancestral states; it is also crucial to simulate realistic data sets. Such simulation procedures are needed to estimate the null-distribution of complex statistics, an approach referred to as parametric bootstrapping, and are also used to test the quality of phylogenetic reconstruction programs. It has often been observed that homologous sequences can vary widely in their nucleotide or amino-acid compositions, revealing that sequence evolution has changed importantly among lineages, and may therefore be most appropriately approached through non-homogeneous models. Several programs implementing such models have been developed, but they are limited in their possibilities: only a few particular models are available for likelihood optimization, and data sets cannot be easily generated using the resulting estimated parameters. RESULTS We hereby present a general implementation of non-homogeneous models of substitutions. It is available as dedicated classes in the Bio++ libraries and can hence be used in any C++ program. Two programs that use these classes are also presented. The first one, Bio++ Maximum Likelihood (BppML), estimates parameters of any non-homogeneous model and the second one, Bio++ Sequence Generator (BppSeqGen), simulates the evolution of sequences from these models. These programs allow the user to describe non-homogeneous models through a property file with a simple yet powerful syntax, without any programming required. CONCLUSION We show that the general implementation introduced here can accommodate virtually any type of non-homogeneous models of sequence evolution, including heterotachous ones, while being computer efficient. We furthermore illustrate the use of such general models for parametric bootstrapping, using tests of non-homogeneity applied to an already published ribosomal RNA data set.},

	abstract = {Friday 12 December 2014 was a red-letter day in the history of ornithology. It saw simultaneous publication of some 27 papers in eight journals, based on a singularly far-reaching and exciting avian dataset: genomic data from 48 species of birds from 32 of the 35 recently proposed avian orders, chosen to span the evolutionary diversity of the class Aves (Zhang et al. 2014a, 2014b, 2014c; Jarvis et al. 2014a, 2014b). The body of work, representing output from more than 200 researchers working in 80 laboratories in 20 countries, reaches almost every corner of ornithology. A flagship paper (Jarvis et al. 2014a) stands on the shoulders of earlier and contemporary work (Hackett et al. 2008; Burleigh et al. 2015) to achieve a nearly complete understanding of relationships among the world’s major avian groups and the timing of the major events in their evolution. A listing of 20 of the papers associated with the dataset is available at http://www.sciencemag.org/content/346/6215/1308/ suppl/DC1 (verified 12 January 2015). One suite of papers, most of which comprise a one-page commentary as well as the full paper, examines the detailed molecular evolution that has made birds the feathered, toothless wonders that they are (Cui et al. 2014; Greenwold et al. 2014; Lovell et al. 2014; Meredith et al. 2014; Romanov et al. 2014; Weber et al. 2014a, 2014b; Wirthlin et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2014c). Another paper thoroughly examines neontological (from living birds) and palaeontological data to reassess the origins of birds (Xu et al. 2014). Next, a series of papers explores the same data to revolutionise other areas of ornithology: the conservation of endangered species (Callicrate et al. 2014; S. Li et al. 2014), the molecular basis of the responses of birds to long-term global climate change (C. Li et al. 2014), the evolution of sex chromosomes in birds (Zhou et al. 2014), and the neurobiology of song and vocal learning (Pfenning et al. 2014; Whitney et al. 2014). Notably, the entirety of the work published on 12 December 2014 rested on two foundations: museum collections of birds often made with no particular view to future uses of individual specimens (Kress 2014) and the need to invent new analytical methods to handle the volume of data involved (Aberer et al. 2014; B. Li et al. 2014; Mirarab et al. 2014a, 2014b, 2014c). Analyses for Jarvis et al. (2014a), conducted on nine supercomputers, took the equivalent of more than 400 years of single-processor computing. A genome is the full complement of DNA sequences in an organism. It represents the code for transcription and production of the proteins that build and define the organism’s phenotype. But the genome is not a homogeneous chunk of DNA evolving at one rate under one evolutionary force. It is more an evolutionary patchwork of many different kinds of DNA sequences. Some parts of the genome code for proteins and have intricate rates of evolution. Other portions do not code for proteins and evolve at other rates. Other non-coding DNA sequences are interspersed between genes, as well as within them, the latter being called introns. SomeDNA sequences move around the genome, inserting themselves into new positions within it. All contribute to a molecular ‘footprint’ of the evolutionary history of the organism carrying the DNA. The range of evolutionary forces that causeDNAsequences to evolve – that is, to change – includes natural selection and the random process of genetic drift among others. This spectrum ofDNAsequences, and their rates of evolution, can be drawn on to answer questions at different evolutionary depths from populations within a species down to commonalities between, say, animals and plants. The more kinds of DNA sequences one can look at, generally, the better are the chances of answering a question using information in DNA.},

	abstract = {Statistical methods for phylogeny estimation, especially maximum likelihood (ML), offer high accuracy with excellent theoretical properties. However, RAxML, the current leading method for large-scale ML estimation, can require weeks or longer when used on datasets with thousands of molecular sequences. Faster methods for ML estimation, among them FastTree, have also been developed, but their relative performance to RAxML is not yet fully understood. In this study, we explore the performance with respect to ML score, running time, and topological accuracy, of FastTree and RAxML on thousands of alignments (based on both simulated and biological nucleotide datasets) with up to 27,634 sequences. We find that when RAxML and FastTree are constrained to the same running time, FastTree produces topologically much more accurate trees in almost all cases. We also find that when RAxML is allowed to run to completion, it provides an advantage over FastTree in terms of the ML score, but does not produce substantially more accurate tree topologies. Interestingly, the relative accuracy of trees computed using FastTree and RAxML depends in part on the accuracy of the sequence alignment and dataset size, so that FastTree can be more accurate than RAxML on large datasets with relatively inaccurate alignments. Finally, the running times of RAxML and FastTree are dramatically different, so that when run to completion, RAxML can take several orders of magnitude longer than FastTree to complete. Thus, our study shows that very large phylogenies can be estimated very quickly using FastTree, with little (and in some cases no) degradation in tree accuracy, as compared to RAxML.},

Because different loci can have different phylogenetic histories (reflected in different gene tree topologies) for multiple biological causes, new approaches to species tree estimation have been developed that take gene tree heterogeneity into account. Among these multiple causes, incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), modeled by the multi-species coalescent, is potentially the most common cause of gene tree heterogeneity, and much of the focus of the recent literature has been on how to estimate species trees in the presence of ILS. Despite progress in developing statistically consistent techniques for estimating species trees when gene trees can differ due to ILS, there is substantial controversy in the systematics community as to whether to use the new coalescent-based methods or the traditional concatenation methods. One of the key issues that has been raised is understanding the impact of gene tree estimation error on coalescent-based methods that operate by combining gene trees. Here we explore the mathematical guarantees of coalescent-based methods when analyzing estimated rather than true gene trees. Our results provide some insight into the differences between promise of coalescent-based methods in theory and their performance in practice.},

Compared with our previous method, the new algorithm is up to 4 orders of magnitude faster, while returning qualitatively identical results. Because of this significant improvement in scalability, the new algorithm can now identify substantially more complex and compute-intensive rogue taxon constellations. On a large and diverse collection of real-world data sets, we show that our method yields better supported reduced/pruned consensus trees than any competing rogue taxon identification method. Using the parallel version of our open-source code, we successfully identified rogue taxa in a set of 100 trees with 116 334 taxa each. For simulated data sets, we show that when removing/pruning rogue taxa with our method from a tree set, we consistently obtain bootstrap consensus trees as well as maximum-likelihood trees that are topologically closer to the respective true trees.},

Although the problem of accurate gene tree inference has received considerable attention, most existing methods are only applicable to gene families unaffected by horizontal gene transfer. As a result, the accurate inference of gene trees affected by horizontal gene transfer remains a largely unaddressed problem. RESULTS: In this study, we introduce a new and highly effective method for gene tree error correction in the presence of horizontal gene transfer. Our method efficiently models horizontal gene transfers, gene duplications and losses, and uses a statistical hypothesis testing framework [Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test] to balance sequence likelihood with topological information from a known species tree. Using a thorough simulation study, we show that existing phylogenetic methods yield inaccurate gene trees when applied to horizontally transferred gene families and that our method dramatically improves gene tree accuracy. We apply our method to a dataset of 11 cyanobacterial species and demonstrate the large impact of gene tree accuracy on downstream evolutionary analyses.

	abstract = {Xenoturbellida and Acoelomorpha are marine worms with contentious ancestry. Both were originally associated with the flatworms (Platyhelminthes), but molecular data have revised their phylogenetic positions, generally linking Xenoturbellida to the deuterostomes and positioning the Acoelomorpha as the most basally branching bilaterian group(s). Recent phylogenomic data suggested that Xenoturbellida and Acoelomorpha are sister taxa and together constitute an early branch of Bilateria. Here we assemble three independent data sets-mitochondrial genes, a phylogenomic data set of 38,330 amino-acid positions and new microRNA (miRNA) complements-and show that the position of Acoelomorpha is strongly affected by a long-branch attraction (LBA) artefact. When we minimize LBA we find consistent support for a position of both acoelomorphs and Xenoturbella within the deuterostomes. The most likely phylogeny links Xenoturbella and Acoelomorpha in a clade we call Xenacoelomorpha. The Xenacoelomorpha is the sister group of the Ambulacraria (hemichordates and echinoderms). We show that analyses of miRNA complements have been affected by character loss in the acoels and that both groups possess one miRNA and the gene Rsb66 otherwise specific to deuterostomes. In addition, Xenoturbella shares one miRNA with the ambulacrarians, and two with the acoels. This phylogeny makes sense of the shared characteristics of Xenoturbellida and Acoelomorpha, such as ciliary ultrastructure and diffuse nervous system, and implies the loss of various deuterostome characters in the Xenacoelomorpha including coelomic cavities, through gut and gill slits.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Bayesian analysis through programs like BEAST (Drummond and Rumbaut, 2007) and MrBayes (Huelsenbeck et al., 2001) provides a powerful method for reconstruction of evolutionary relationships. One of the benefits of Bayesian methods is that well-founded estimates of uncertainty in models can be made available. So, for example, not only the mean time of a most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) is estimated, but also the spread. This distribution over model space is represented by a set of trees, which can be rather large and difficult to interpret. DensiTree is a tool that helps navigating these sets of trees. RESULTS: The main idea behind DensiTree is to draw all trees in the set transparently. As a result, areas where a lot of the trees agree in topology and branch lengths show up as highly colored areas, while areas with little agreement show up as webs. This makes it possible to quickly get an impression of properties of the tree set such as well-supported clades, distribution of tMRCA and areas of topological uncertainty. Thus, DensiTree provides a quick method for qualitative analysis of tree sets. AVAILABILITY: DensiTree is freely available from http://compevol.auckland.ac.nz/software/DensiTree/.

In this paper, we report on a simulation study that we performed to evaluate the consequences of using these new multiple sequence alignment methods in terms of the resultant phylogenetic reconstruction. We find that while alignment accuracy is positively correlated with phylogenetic accuracy, the amount of improvement in phylogenetic estimation that results from an improved alignment can range from quite small to substantial. We observe that phylogenetic accuracy is most highly correlated with alignment accuracy when sequences are most difficult to align, and that variation in alignment accuracy can have little impact on phylogenetic accuracy when alignment error rates are generally low.

In this paper, I review the effects of missing data on phylogenetic analyses. Recent simulations suggest that highly incomplete taxa can be accurately placed in phylogenies, as long as many characters have been sampled overall. Furthermore, adding incomplete taxa can dramatically improve results in some cases by subdividing misleading long branches. Adding characters with missing data can also improve accuracy, although there is a risk of long-branch attraction in some cases.

Traditionally, successful horizontal gene transfer was assumed to provide a selective advantage to either the host or the gene itself, but could horizontally transferred genes be neutral or nearly neutral?

We show that support for Amborella as the sole representative of the most basal angiosperm lineage is founded on sequence site patterns poorly described by time-reversible substitution models. Improving the fit between sequence data and substitution model identifies Trithuria, Nymphaeaceae, and Amborella as surviving relatives of the most basal lineage of flowering plants.

	abstract = {Abstract The estimation of species trees typically involves the estimation of trees and alignments on many different genes, so that the species tree can be based on many different parts of the genome. This kind of phylogenomic approach to species tree estimation has the potential to produce more accurate species tree estimates, especially when gene trees can differ from the species tree due to processes such as incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), gene duplication and loss, and horizontal gene transfer. Because ILS (also called "deep coalescence") is a frequent problem in systematics, many methods have been developed to estimate species trees from gene trees or alignments that specifically take ILS into consideration. In this paper we consider the problem of estimating species trees from gene trees and alignments for the general case where the gene trees and alignments can be incomplete, which means that not all the genes contain sequences for all the species. We formalize optimization problems for this context and prove theoretical results for these problems. We also present the results of a simulation study evaluating existing methods for estimating species trees from incomplete gene trees. Our simulation study shows that BEAST, a statistical method for estimating species trees from gene sequence alignments, produces by far the most accurate species trees. However, BEAST can only be run on small datasets. The second most accurate method, MRP (a standard supertree method), can analyze very large datasets and produces very good trees, making MRP a potentially acceptable alternative to BEAST for large datasets.},

The independent features include the eukaryotic lobes and the archaebacterial bill on the smaller subunit. On the larger subunit, they include the eocytic lobe, eocytic gap, and eocytic bulge and a modified central protuberance. These data are most parsimoniously fit by a single unrooted evolutionary tree. In this tree eocytes are closely related to eukaryotes, while archaebacteria and eubacteria are closest neighbors. The tree is consistent with currently known molecular biological properties and indicates that eocytes have a phylogenetic importance equal to that of the three known kingdoms.

In biology, one of the most promising approaches to tree reconstruction is to find the "maximum parsimony" tree, while in linguistics, the use of the "maximum compatibility" method has been very useful. However, these problems are NP-hard, and current approaches to solving these problems amount to heuristic searches through the space of possible tree topologies (a search which can, on large trees, take months to complete). In this paper, we present a new technique, Optimal Tree Refinement, for reconstructing very large trees. Our technique is motivated by recent experimental studies which have shown that certain polynomial time methods often return contractions of the true tree. We study the use of this technique in solving maximum parsimony and maximum compatibility, and present both hardness results and polynomial time algorithms.},

Different types of data analyses particular to metagenomes are then presented, including binning, dominant population analysis, and gene-centric analysis.

Specifically, little attention has been paid to scenarios where outgroups have evolved different nucleotide frequencies from the ingroup. We investigate one empirical example that arose seeking to determine the phylogenetic relationship between the saltans and the willistoni groups of Drosophila (subgenus Sophophora). We have analyzed 2085 coding nucleotides from the xanthine dehydrogenase (Xdh) gene in 14 species, 6 from the saltans group and 8 from the willistoni group. We adopt a two-step strategy: (1) we investigate the phylogeny without outgroups, rooting the network by the midpoint method; (2) we reinvestigate the rooting of this phylogeny using predefined outgroups in both a parsimony- and a model-based maximum-likelihood framework. A satisfactory description of the substitution process along the Xdh region calls for six substitution types and substitution rate variation among codon positions. When the ingroup sequences are considered alone, the phylogeny obtained using this description corroborates the known relationships derived from anatomical criteria. Inclusion of the outgroups makes the root unstable, apparently because of differences between ingroups and outgroups in the substitution processes; these differences are better accounted for by a simplified model of evolution than by more complex, realistic descriptions of the substitution process.},

	abstract = {We have characterized the relationship between accurate phylogenetic reconstruction and sequence similarity, testing whether high levels of sequence similarity can consistently produce accurate evolutionary trees. We generated protein families with known phylogenies using a modified version of the PAML/EVOLVER program that produces insertions and deletions as well as substitutions. Protein families were evolved over a range of 100-400 point accepted mutations; at these distances 63\% of the families shared significant sequence similarity. Protein families were evolved using balanced and unbalanced trees, with ancient or recent radiations. In families sharing statistically significant similarity, about 60\% of multiple sequence alignments were 95\% identical to true alignments. To compare recovered topologies with true topologies, we used a score that reflects the fraction of clades that were correctly clustered. As expected, the accuracy of the phylogenies was greatest in the least divergent families. About 88\% of phylogenies clustered over 80\% of clades in families that shared significant sequence similarity, using Bayesian, parsimony, distance, and maximum likelihood methods. However, for protein families with short ancient branches (ancient radiation), only 30\% of the most divergent (but statistically significant) families produced accurate phylogenies, and only about 70\% of the second most highly conserved families, with median expectation values better than 10(-60), produced accurate trees. These values represent upper bounds on expected tree accuracy for sequences with a simple divergence history; proteins from 700 Giardia families, with a similar range of sequence similarities but considerably more gaps, produced much less accurate trees. For our simulated insertions and deletions, correct multiple sequence alignments did not perform much better than those produced by T-COFFEE, and including sequences with expressed sequence tag-like sequencing errors did not significantly decrease phylogenetic accuracy. In general, although less-divergent sequence families produce more accurate trees, the likelihood of estimating an accurate tree is most dependent on whether radiation in the family was ancient or recent. Accuracy can be improved by combining genes from the same organism when creating species trees or by selecting protein families with the best bootstrap values in comprehensive studies.},

We propose a synthesis of genetic and fossil evidence consistent with placing the human-chimpanzee and human-chimpanzee-gorilla speciation events at approximately 6 and 10 million years ago. In 30{\textbackslash}\% of the genome, gorilla is closer to human or chimpanzee than the latter are to each other; this is rarer around coding genes, indicating pervasive selection throughout great ape evolution, and has functional consequences in gene expression. A comparison of protein coding genes reveals approximately 500 genes showing accelerated evolution on each of the gorilla, human and chimpanzee lineages, and evidence for parallel acceleration, particularly of genes involved in hearing. We also compare the western and eastern gorilla species, estimating an average sequence divergence time 1.75 million years ago, but with evidence for more recent genetic exchange and a population bottleneck in the eastern species. The use of the genome sequence in these and future analyses will promote a deeper understanding of great ape biology and evolution.},

Although more recent multigene concatenated analyses have refined the relationships among the many branches of eukaryotes, the root of the eukaryotic tree of life has remained elusive. Inferring the root of extant eukaryotes is challenging because of the age of the group (∼1.7-2.1 billion years old), tremendous heterogeneity in rates of evolution among lineages, and lack of obvious outgroups for many genes. Here, we reconstruct a rooted phylogeny of extant eukaryotes based on minimizing the number of duplications and losses among a collection of gene trees. This approach does not require outgroup sequences or assumptions of orthology among sequences. We also explore the impact of taxon and gene sampling and assess support for alternative hypotheses for the root. Using 20 gene trees from 84 diverse eukaryotic lineages, this approach recovers robust eukaryotic clades and reveals evidence for a eukaryotic root that lies between the Opisthokonta (animals, fungi and their microbial relatives) and all remaining eukaryotes.},

This combination of long and short branches can contribute to long-branch artifacts (LBA). Despite efforts to remedy LBA via increased taxon sampling and methodological improvements in gene tree estimation, it remains unclear how long and short branches affect species tree estimation in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Here, we examine the combined influence of long external and short internal branches on concatenation and coalescent methods using both simulated and empirical data. Our results demonstrate that the presence of long and short branches alone does not obviously confound the consistency of concatenation and coalescent methods. However, when long external and short internal branches occur simultaneously with high ILS, concatenation methods can be misled, especially when two of these long branches are sister lineages. In contrast, coalescent methods are more robust under these circumstances. This is particularly relevant because this topological pattern also characterizes numerous ancient rapid radiations across the tree of life. Because short internal branches can increase the potential for ILS and gene tree discordance, our results collectively suggest that coalescent methods are more likely to infer the correct species tree in cases of ancient rapid radiations where long external and short internal branches are in close phylogenetic proximity.},

We described race/ethnicity and age of potential transmission partners of MSM.{\textbackslash}nResults: Of 23 048 MSM with HIV sequences submitted to NHSS during 2000–2012, we identified potential transmission partners for 8880 (39\%). Most potential transmission partners were of the same race/ethnicity (78\% for blacks/African-Americans, 64\% for whites and 49\% for Hispanics/Latinos). This assortative mixing was even more pronounced in the youngest age groups. Significantly fewer young black/African-American and Hispanic/Latino MSM had older potential transmission partners than young white MSM.{\textbackslash}nConclusion: Black/African-American MSM, who are more profoundly affected by HIV, were more likely to have potential HIV transmission partners who were of the same race/ethnicity and similar in age, suggesting that disparities in HIV infections are in large part not due to age-disassortative relationships. Concerted efforts to increase access to preexposure prophylaxis, quality HIV care and effective treatment are needed to interrupt transmission chains among young, black/African-American MSM.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: GemSIM, or General Error-Model based SIMulator, is a next-generation sequencing simulator capable of generating single or paired-end reads for any sequencing technology compatible with the generic formats SAM and FASTQ (including Illumina and Roche/454). GemSIM creates and uses empirically derived, sequence-context based error models to realistically emulate individual sequencing runs and/or technologies. Empirical fragment length and quality score distributions are also used. Reads may be drawn from one or more genomes or haplotype sets, facilitating simulation of deep sequencing, metagenomic, and resequencing projects.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: We demonstrate GemSIM's value by deriving error models from two different Illumina sequencing runs and one Roche/454 run, and comparing and contrasting the resulting error profiles of each run. Overall error rates varied dramatically, both between individual Illumina runs, between the first and second reads in each pair, and between datasets from Illumina and Roche/454 technologies. Indels were markedly more frequent in Roche/454 than Illumina and both technologies suffered from an increase in error rates near the end of each read.The effects of these different profiles on low-frequency SNP-calling accuracy were investigated by analysing simulated sequencing data for a mixture of bacterial haplotypes. In general, SNP-calling using VarScan was only accurate for SNPs with frequency {\textgreater} 3\%, independent of which error model was used to simulate the data. Variation between error profiles interacted strongly with VarScan's 'minumum average quality' parameter, resulting in different optimal settings for different sequencing runs.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Next-generation sequencing has unprecedented potential for assessing genetic diversity, however analysis is complicated as error profiles can vary noticeably even between different runs of the same technology. Simulation with GemSIM can help overcome this problem, by providing insights into the error profiles of individual sequencing runs and allowing researchers to assess the effects of these errors on downstream data analysis.},

As expected, corrected parsimony was consistent. For these data, maximum likelihood with the clock assumption outperformed each of the other methods tested. The distance-based methods performed marginally better than did maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood without the clock assumption. Data correction was generally detrimental to accuracy, especially for short sequence lengths. We identified another region of the parameter space where, although consistent for a given method, some incorrect trees were each selected with up to twice the frequency of the correct (generating) tree for sequences of bounded length. These incorrect trees are those where the outgroup has been incorrectly placed. In addition to this problem, the placement of the outgroup sequence can have a confounding effect on the ingroup tree, whereby the ingroup is correct when using the ingroup sequences alone, but with the inclusion of the outgroup the ingroup tree becomes incorrect.},

In the last few years, models designed to understand diversification from phylogenetic data have advanced significantly. Here, I review these approaches and what they have revealed about diversification in the natural world. I focus on key distinctions between different models, and I clarify the conclusions that can be drawn from each model. I identify promising areas for future research. A major challenge ahead is to develop models that more explicitly take into account ecology, in particular the interaction of species with each other and with their environment. This will not only improve our understanding of diversification; it will also present a new perspective to the use of phylogenies in community ecology, the science of interaction networks and conservation biology, and might shift the current focus in ecology on equilibrium biodiversity theories to non-equilibrium theories recognising the crucial role of history.},

A second model assumes that each topological type is equally likely (equiprobable model). A third model assumes that the probability of each topological type is determined by random speciation (Markov model). We sampled published phylogenetic trees from three major groups of organisms: division Angiospermae, class Insecta, and superclass Tetrapoda. Our sampling was more restricted than previous studies and was designed to test whether observed topological frequencies were distinguishable from those predicted by the three null models. The pattern of evolution reflected in five-member phylogenetic trees is different from predictions of the equiprobable and Markov model but is indistinguishable from the proportional-to- distinguishable-arrangements model. This indicates that 1) speciation (and/or extinction) is not equally likely among all taxa, even for small phylogenies; or 2) systematists' attempts at reconstructing small phylogenies are, on average, indistinguishable from those expected if they had merely selected a tree at random from the pool of all possible trees. The topology frequencies were not different among the three groups of organisms, suggesting that factors shaping patterns of speciation and extinction are consistent among major taxonomic groups.},

However, phylogenetic analyses of few taxa (but each represented by many characters) can be subject to strong systematic biases, which in turn produce high measures of repeatability (such as bootstrap proportions) in support of incorrect or misleading phylogenetic results. Thus, it is important for phylogeneticists to consider both the sampling of taxa, as well as the sampling of characters, in designing phylogenetic studies. Taxon sampling also improves estimates of evolutionary parameters derived from phylogenetic trees, and is thus important for improved applications of phylogenetic analyses. Analysis of sensitivity to taxon inclusion, the possible effects of long-branch attraction, and sensitivity of parameter estimation for model-based methods should be a part of any careful and thorough phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, recent improvements in phylogenetic algorithms and in computational power have removed many constraints on analyzing large, thoroughly sampled data sets. Thorough taxon sampling is thus one of the most practical ways to improve the accuracy of phylogenetic estimates, as well as the accuracy of biological inferences that are based on these phylogenetic trees.},

In response to these conclusions, Zwickl and Hillis (2002) and Pollock et al. (2002) conducted additional simulations and reanalyzed the data presented by Rosenberg and Kumar (2001). Zwickl and Hillis and Pollock et al. showed that these conclusions of Rosenberg and Kumar could not be supported either by analyses of their original data or by new simulations that corrected a number of deficiencies in Rosenberg and Kumar�s original experimental design. Both Zwickl and Hillis and Pollock et al. found that increased taxon sampling resulted in greatly reduced phylogenetic estimation error, and Pollock et al. showed that the benefits of increased taxon sampling were similar to adding an equivalent amount of sequence length for the same taxa (in the ranges simulated by Rosenberg and Kumar). In their response, Rosenberg and Kumar (2002) focused on a slightly different conclusion from that in their original paper, which was that  �longer sequences, rather than extensive sampling, will better improve the accuracy of phylogenetic inference� (2001:10751). In 2001, Rosenberg and Kumar argued that the beneficial effect of increasing taxa was 10-fold lower than the beneficial effect of increasing sequence length and that the effects of increased taxon sampling for the same genes were negligible (�largely independently� of phylogenetic error). Rosenberg and Kumar (2002) have now concluded that the beneficial effect of increasing taxon sample size is not small, but they suggested that the benefit comes simply from the overall increase in size of the data matrix (the total number of characters�taxa). Furthermore, they maintained that there is a greater benefit to increasing the total sequence length for few taxa than can be obtained by increasing taxon sampling for the same genes. Here, we discuss the two sets of conclusions reached by Rosenberg and Kumar (2001, 2002).},

These metrics can be used in conjunction with permutation procedures to test for phylogenetic community structure.

The fish communities showed phylogenetic underdispersion, with communities more likely to contain closely related species. Using information about differences in environmental characteristics among lakes, we demonstrated that phylogenetic underdispersion in fish communities was associated with environmental factors. For example, lakes with low pH were more likely to contain species in the same clade of acid-tolerant species. Our metrics differ from existing metrics used to calculate phylogenetic community structure, such as net relatedness index and Faith's phylogenetic diversity. Our metrics have the advantage of providing an integrated and easy-to-understand package of phylogenetic measures of species variability, richness, and evenness with well-defined statistical properties. Furthermore, they allow the easy evaluation of contributions of individual species to different aspects of the phylogenetic organization of communities. Therefore, these metrics should aid with the incorporation of phylogenetic information into strategies for understanding biodiversity and its conservation.},

	abstract = {Orthologs are genes in different species that originate from a single gene in the last common ancestor of these species. Such genes have often retained identical biological roles in the present-day organisms. It is hence important to identify orthologs for transferring functional information between genes in different organisms with a high degree of reliability. For example, orthologs of human proteins are often functionally characterized in model organisms. Unfortunately, orthology analysis between human and e.g. invertebrates is often complex because of large numbers of paralogs within protein families. Paralogs that predate the species split, which we call out-paralogs, can easily be confused with true orthologs. Paralogs that arose after the species split, which we call in-paralogs, however, are bona fide orthologs by definition. Orthologs and in-paralogs are typically detected with phylogenetic methods, but these are slow and difficult to automate. Automatic clustering methods based on two-way best genome-wide matches on the other hand, have so far not separated in-paralogs from out-paralogs effectively. We present a fully automatic method for finding orthologs and in-paralogs from two species. Ortholog clusters are seeded with a two-way best pairwise match, after which an algorithm for adding in-paralogs is applied. The method bypasses multiple alignments and phylogenetic trees, which can be slow and error-prone steps in classical ortholog detection. Still, it robustly detects complex orthologous relationships and assigns confidence values for both orthologs and in-paralogs. The program, called INPARANOID, was tested on all completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes. To assess the quality of INPARANOID results, ortholog clusters were generated from a dataset of worm and mammalian transmembrane proteins, and were compared to clusters derived by manual tree-based ortholog detection methods. This study led to the identification with a high degree of confidence of over a dozen novel worm-mammalian ortholog assignments that were previously undetected because of shortcomings of phylogenetic methods.A WWW server that allows searching for orthologs between human and several fully sequenced genomes is installed at http://www.cgb.ki.se/inparanoid/. This is the first comprehensive resource with orthologs of all fully sequenced eukaryotic genomes. Programs and tables of orthology assignments are available from the same location.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic trees are important in many areas of biological research, ranging from systematic studies to the methods used for genome annotation. Finding the best scoring tree under any optimality criterion is an NP-hard problem, which necessitates the use of heuristics for tree-search. Although tree-search plays a major role in obtaining a tree estimate, there remains a limited understanding of its characteristics and how the elements of the statistical inferential procedure interact with the algorithms used. This study begins to answer some of these questions through a detailed examination of maximum likelihood tree-search on a wide range of real genome-scale data sets. We examine all 10,395 trees for each of the 106 genes of an eight-taxa yeast phylogenomic data set, then apply different tree-search algorithms to investigate their performance. We extend our findings by examining two larger genome-scale data sets and a large disparate data set that has been previously used to benchmark the performance of tree-search programs. We identify several broad trends occurring during tree-search that provide an insight into the performance of heuristics and may, in the future, aid their development. These trends include a tendency for the true maximum likelihood (best) tree to also be the shortest tree in terms of branch lengths, a weak tendency for tree-search to recover the best tree, and a tendency for tree-search to encounter fewer local optima in genes that have a high information content. When examining current heuristics for tree-search, we find that nearest-neighbor-interchange performs poorly, and frequently finds trees that are significantly different from the best tree. In contrast, subtree-pruning-and-regrafting tends to perform well, nearly always finding trees that are not significantly different to the best tree. Finally, we demonstrate that the precise implementation of a tree-search strategy, including when and where parameters are optimized, can change the character of tree-search, and that good strategies for tree-search may combine existing tree-search programs.},

In this paper, we describe a new tree-rearrangement operation which we call the p-ECR move, for p-Edge-Contract-and-Refine. Our results include an efficient algorithm for computing the best 2-ECR neighbors of a given tree, based upon a simple data structure which also allows us to efficiently calculate the best neighbors under NNI, SPR, and TBR operations (as well as efficiently running the greedy sequence addition technique for maximum parsimony). More significantly, we show that the 2-ECR neighborhood of a given tree is incomparable to the neighborhood defined by TBR, and properly contains all trees within two NNI moves. Hence, the use of the 2-ECR move, in conjunction with TBR and/or NNI moves, may be a more effective technique for exploring tree space than TBR alone.},

We present a novel algorithm (SATCHMO) that is designed to address this challenge. SATCHMO simultaneously constructs a tree and a set of multiple sequence alignments, one for each internal node of the tree. The alignment at a given node contains all sequences within its sub-tree, and predicts which positions in those sequences are alignable and which are not. Aligned regions therefore typically get shorter on a path from a leaf to the root as sequences diverge in structure. Current methods either regard all positions as alignable (e.g. ClustalW), or align only those positions believed to be homologous across all sequences (e.g. profile HMM methods); by contrast SATCHMO makes different predictions of alignable regions in different subgroups. SATCHMO generates profile hidden Markov models at each node; these are used to determine branching order, to align sequences and to predict structurally alignable regions. RESULTS: In experiments on the BAliBASE benchmark alignment database, SATCHMO is shown to perform comparably to ClustalW and the UCSC SAM HMM software. Results using SATCHMO to identify protein domains are demonstrated on potassium channels, with implications for the mechanism by which tumor necrosis factor alpha affects potassium current.

Although bootstrapping was first applied in phylogenetics to assess the repeatability of a given result, bootstrap results are commonly interpreted as a measure of the probability that a phylogenetic estimate represents the true phylogeny. Here we use computer simulations and a laboratory-generated phylogeny to test bootstrapping results of parsimony analyses, both as measures of repeatability (i.e., the probability of repeating a result given a new sample of characters) and accuracy (i.e., the probability that a result represents the true phylogeny). Our results indicate that any given bootstrap proportion provides an unbiased but highly imprecise measure of repeatability, unless the actual probability of replicating the relevant result is nearly one. The imprecision of the estimate is great enough to render the estimate virtually useless as a measure of repeatability. Under conditions thought to be typical of most phylogenetic analyses, however, bootstrap proportions in majority-rule consensus trees provide biased but highly conservative estimates of the probability of correctly inferring the corresponding clades. Specifically, under conditions of equal rates of change, symmetric phylogenies, and internodal change of [\&le;]20\% of the characters, bootstrap proportions of [\&ge;]70\% usually correspond to a probability of [\&ge;]95\% that the corresponding clade is real. However, under conditions of very high rates of internodal change (approaching randomization of the characters among taxa) or highly unequal rates of change among taxa, bootstrap proportions {\textgreater}50\% are overestimates of accuracy.},

	title = {Genetic algorithm approaches for the phylogenetic analysis of large biological sequence datasets under the maximum likelihood criterion},
	abstract = {Phylogenetic trees have a multitude of applications in biology, epidemiology, conservation and even forensics. However, the inference of phylogenetic trees can be extremely computationally intensive. The computational burden of such analyses becomes even greater when model-based methods are used. Model-based methods have been repeatedly shown to be the most accurate choice for the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees, and thus are an attractive choice despite their high computational demands. Using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) criterion to choose among phylogenetic trees is one commonly used model-based technique. Until recently, software for performing ML analyses of biological sequence data was largely intractable for more than about one hundred sequences. Because advances in sequencing technology now make the assembly of datasets consisting of thousands of sequences common, ML search algorithms that are able to quickly and accurately analyze such data must be developed if ML techniques are to remain a viable option in the future. I have developed a fast and accurate algorithm that allows ML phylogenetic searches to be performed on datasets consisting of thousands of sequences. My software uses a genetic algorithm approach, and is named GARLI (Genetic Algorithm for Rapid Likelihood Inference). The speed of this new algorithm results primarily from its novel technique for partial optimization of branch-length parameters following topological rearrangements. Experiments performed with GARLI show that it is able to analyze large datasets in a small fraction of the time required by the previous generation of search algorithms. The program also performs well relative to two other recently introduced fast ML search programs. Large parallel computer clusters have become common at academic institutions in recent years, presenting a new resource to be used for phylogenetic analyses. The P- GARLI algorithm extends the approach of GARLI to allow simultaneous use of many computer processors. The processors may be instructed to work together on a phylogenetic search in either a highly coordinated or largely independent fashion. Preliminary experiments suggest that analyses using the P-GARLI software can result in better solutions than can be obtained with the serial GARLI algorithm.},

	abstract = {Comparative evolutionary analyses of molecular sequences are solely based on the identities and differences detected between homologous characters. Errors in this homology statement, that is errors in the align- ment of the sequences, are likely to lead to errors in the downstream analyses. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic inference are tightly connected and many popular alignment programs use the phylogeny to divide the alignment problem into smaller tasks. They then neglect the phylogenetic tree, however, and produce alignments that are not evolutionarily meaningful. The use of phylogeny-aware methods reduces the error but the resulting alignments, with evolutionarily correct representation of homology, can challenge the existing practices and methods for viewing and visualising the sequences. The inter- dependency of alignment and phylogeny can be resolved by joint estimation of the two; methods based on statistical models allow for inferring the alignment parameters from the data and correctly take into account the uncertainty of the solution but remain computationally challenging. Widely used alignment methods are based on heuristic algorithms and unlikely to find globally optimal solutions. The whole concept of one correct alignment for the sequences is questionable, however, as there typically exist vast numbers of alternative, roughly equally good alignments that should also be considered. This uncertainty is hidden by many popular alignment programs and is rarely correctly taken into account in the downstream analyses. The quest for finding and improving the alignment solution is complicated by the lack of suitable measures of alignment goodness. The difficulty of comparing alternative solutions also affects benchmarks of alignment methods and the results strongly depend on the measure used. As the effects of alignment error cannot be predicted, comparing the alignments’ performance in downstream analyses is recommended.},

	abstract = {We describe a new method (T-Coffee) for multiple sequence alignment that provides a dramatic improvement in accuracy with a modest sacrifice in speed as compared to the most commonly used alternatives. The method is broadly based on the popular progressive approach to multiple alignment but avoids the most serious pitfalls caused by the greedy nature of this algorithm. With T-Coffee we pre-process a data set of all pair-wise alignments between the sequences. This provides us with a library of alignment information that can be used to guide the progressive alignment. Intermediate alignments are then based not only on the sequences to be aligned next but also on how all of the sequences align with each other. This alignment information can be derived from heterogeneous sources such as a mixture of alignment programs and/or structure superposition. Here, we illustrate the power of the approach by using a combination of local and global pair-wise alignments to generate the library. The resulting alignments are significantly more reliable, as determined by comparison with a set of 141 test cases, than any of the popular alternatives that we tried. The improvement, especially clear with the more difficult test cases, is always visible, regardless of the phylogenetic spread of the sequences in the tests.},

One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match. Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids.

The problem is straightforward only if one restricts consideration to contiguous subsequences (segments)containingno internal deletions or insertions.The more general problem has its solution in an extension of sequence metrics (Sellers 1974; Waterman et al., 1976)developed to measure the minimum number of “events” required to convert one sequence into another. These developments in the modern sequence analysis began with the heuristic homology algorithm of Needleman \& Wunsch (1970) which first introduced an iterative matrix method of calculation. Numerous other heuristic algorithms have been suggested including those of Fitch (1966)and Dayhoff (1969).More mathemat- ically rigorous algorithms were suggested by Sankoff (1972), Reichert et al. (1973) and Beyer et al. (1979), but these were generally not biologically satisfying or interpretable. Success came with Sellers (1974)development of a true metric mewure of the distance between sequences. This metric was later generalized by Waterman et al. (1976) to include deletions/insertions of arbitrary length. This metric represents the minimum number of “mutational events” required to convert one sequenceintoanother.ItisofinteresttonotethatSmithet al.(1980)haverecently shown that under someconditions the generalized Sellers metric is equivalentto the original homology algorithm of Needleman \& Wunsch (1970).

Simulation of sequences containing insertion and deletion events was performed in order to determine the role that alignment accuracy plays during phylogenetic inference. Data sets were simulated for pectinate, balanced, and random tree shapes under different conditions (ultrametric equal branch length, ultrametric random branch length, nonultrametric random branch length). Comparisons between hypothesized alignments and true alignments enabled determination of two measures of alignment accuracy, that of the total data set and that of individual branches. In general, our results indicate that as alignment error increases, topological accuracy decreases. This trend was much more pronounced for data sets derived from more pectinate topologies. In contrast, for balanced, ultrametric, equal branch length tree shapes, alignment inaccuracy had little average effect on tree reconstruction. These conclusions are based on average trends of many analyses under different conditions, and any one specific analysis, independent of the alignment accuracy, may recover very accurate or inaccurate topologies. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian, in general, outperformed neighbor joining and maximum parsimony in terms of tree reconstruction accuracy. Results also indicated that as the length of the branch and of the neighboring branches increase, alignment accuracy decreases, and the length of the neighboring branches is the major factor in topological accuracy. Thus, multiple-sequence alignment can be an important factor in downstream effects on topological reconstruction.},

Molecular-clock studies consistently date the emergence of modern bird orders at ∼100 million years ago or older, coincidental with major continental breakup. This is supported by some biogeographers who use phylogenetics, accept an ancient evolutionary origin and use historical geology to guide their reasoning. The fossil record, however, provides evidence that modern birds represent an explosive Tertiary radiation, following the Cretaceous-Tertiary cataclysm, and their origins are almost 50 million years younger than that predicted by molecular studies. Here, I argue that this explosive, punctuated model conforms to the typical pattern of vertebrate evolution characterized by rapid diversification following a major extinction event.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Species tree estimation in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) is a major challenge for phylogenomic analysis. Although many methods have been developed for this problem, little is understood about the relative performance of these methods when estimated gene trees are poorly estimated, owing to inadequate phylogenetic signal. RESULTS: We explored the performance of some methods for estimating species trees from multiple markers on simulated datasets in which gene trees differed from the species tree owing to ILS. We included *BEAST, concatenated analysis and several 'summary methods': BUCKy, MP-EST, minimize deep coalescence, matrix representation with parsimony and the greedy consensus. We found that *BEAST and concatenation gave excellent results, often with substantially improved accuracy over the other methods. We observed that *BEAST's accuracy is largely due to its ability to co-estimate the gene trees and species tree. However, *BEAST is computationally intensive, making it challenging to run on datasets with 100 or more genes or with more than 20 taxa. We propose a new approach to species tree estimation in which the genes are partitioned into sets, and the species tree is estimated from the resultant 'supergenes'. We show that this technique improves the scalability of *BEAST without affecting its accuracy and improves the accuracy of the summary methods. Thus, naive binning can improve phylogenomic analysis in the presence of ILS. CONTACT: tandy@cs.utexas.edu SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Inference of phylogenetic trees comprising hundreds or even thousands of organisms based on the maximum likelihood method is computationally intensive. We present simple heuristics which yield accurate trees for synthetic as well as real data and significantly reduce execution time. Those heuristics have been implemented in a sequential, parallel, and distributed program called RAxML-II which is freely available as open source code. We compare the performance of the sequential program with PHYML and MrBayes which-to the best of our knowledge-are currently the fastest and most accurate programs for phylogenetic tree inference based on statistical methods. Experiments are conducted using 50 synthetic 100 taxon alignments as well as nine real-world alignments comprising 101 up to 1000 sequences. RAxML-II outperforms MrBayes for real-world data both in terms of speed and final likelihood values. Furthermore, for real data RAxML-II requires less time (a factor of 2-8) than PHYML to reach PHYML's final likelihood values and yields better final trees due to its more exhaustive search strategy. For synthetic data MrBayes is slightly more accurate than RAxML-II and PHYML but significantly slower. The non-deterministic parallel program shows good speedup values and has been used to infer a 10 000-taxon tree comprising organisms from the domains Eukarya, Bacteria, and Archaea.

The expected time of divergence between the two most closely related genes sampled from two different populations and the time of divergence (coalescence) of all genes sampled are studied by using this theory. It is shown that the time of divergence between the two most closely related genes can be used as an approximate estimate of the time of population splitting (T) only when T identical to t/(2N) is small, where t and N are the number of generations and the effective population size, respectively. The variance of Nei and Li's estimate (d) of the number of net nucleotide differences between two populations is also studied. It is shown that the standard error (Sd) of d is larger than the mean when T is small (T much less than 1). In this case, Sd is reduced considerably by increasing sample size. When T is large (T greater than 1), however, a large proportion of the variance of d is caused by stochastic factors, and increase in the sample size does not help to reduce Sd. To reduce the stochastic variance of d, one must use data from many independent unlinked gene loci.},

It involves resampling points from one's own data, with replacement, to create a series of bootstrap samples of the same size as the original data. Each of these is analyzed, and the variation among the resulting estimates taken to indicate the size of the error involved in making estimates from the original data. In the case of phylogenies, it is argued that the proper method of resampling is to keep all of the original species while sampling characters with replacement, under the assumption that the characters have been independently drawn by the systematist and have evolved independently. Majority-rule consensus trees can be used to construct a phylogeny showing all of the inferred monophyletic groups that occurred in a majority of the bootstrap samples. If a group shows up 95\% of the time or more, the evidence for it is taken to be statistically significant. Existing computer programs can be used to analyze different bootstrap samples by using weights on the characters, the weight of a character being how many times it was drawn in bootstrap sampling. When all characters are perfectly compatible, as envisioned by Hennig, bootstrap sampling becomes unnecessary; the bootstrap method would show significant evidence for a group if it is defined by three or more characters.},

An important application of consensus methods is to combine gene trees to estimate a species tree. To investigate the theoretical properties of consensus trees that would be obtained from large numbers of loci evolving according to a basic evolutionary model, we construct consensus trees from rooted gene trees that occur in proportion to gene-tree probabilities derived from coalescent theory. We consider majority-rule, rooted triple (R*), and greedy consensus trees obtained from known, rooted gene trees, both in the asymptotic case as numbers of gene trees approach infinity and for finite numbers of genes. Our results show that for some combinations of species-tree branch lengths, increasing the number of independent loci can make the rooted majority-rule consensus tree more likely to be at least partially unresolved. However, the probability that the R* consensus tree has the species-tree topology approaches 1 as the number of gene trees approaches ∞. Although the greedy consensus algorithm can be the quickest to converge on the correct species-tree topology when increasing the number of gene trees, it can also be positively misleading. The majority-rule consensus tree is not a misleading estimator of the species-tree topology, and the R* consensus tree is a statistically consistent estimator of the species-tree topology. Our results therefore suggest a method for using multiple loci to infer the species-tree topology, even when it is discordant with the most likely gene tree.},

To rapidly construct a reasonable MSA, we developed the initial version of the MAFFT program in 2002. MSA software is now facing greater challenges in both scalability and accuracy than those of 5 years ago. As increasing amounts of sequence data are being generated by large-scale sequencing projects, scalability is now critical in many situations. The requirement of accuracy has also entered a new stage since the discovery of functional noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs); the secondary structure should be considered for constructing a high-quality alignment of distantly related ncRNAs. To deal with these problems, in 2007, we updated MAFFT to Version 6 with two new techniques: the PartTree algorithm and the Four-way consistency objective function. The former improved the scalability of progressive alignment and the latter improved the accuracy of ncRNA alignment. We review these and other techniques that MAFFT uses and suggest possible future directions of MSA software as a basis of comparative analyses.
