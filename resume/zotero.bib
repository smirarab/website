	abstract = {Despite tremendous efforts in the past decades, relationships among main avian lineages remain heavily debated without a clear resolution. Discrepancies have been attributed to diversity of species sampled, phylogenetic method, and the choice of genomic regions 1–3. Here, we address these issues by analyzing genomes of 363 bird species 4 (218 taxonomic families, 92\% of total). Using intergenic regions and coalescent methods, we present a well-supported tree but also a remarkable degree of discordance. The tree confirms that Neoaves experienced rapid radiation at or near the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) boundary. Sufficient loci rather than extensive taxon sampling were more effective in resolving difficult nodes. Remaining recalcitrant nodes involve species that challenge modeling due to extreme GC content, variable substitution rates, incomplete lineage sorting, or complex evolutionary events such as ancient hybridization. Assessment of the impacts of different genomic partitions showed high heterogeneity across the genome. We discovered sharp increases in effective population size, substitution rates, and relative brain size following the K–Pg extinction event, supporting the hypothesis that emerging ecological opportunities catalyzed the diversification of modern birds. The resulting phylogenetic estimate offers novel insights into the rapid radiation of modern birds and provides a taxon-rich backbone tree for future comparative studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Species tree estimation can be challenging in the presence of gene tree conflict due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), which can occur when the time between speciation events is short relative to the population size. Of the many methods that have been developed to estimate species trees in the presence of ILS, *BEAST, a Bayesian method that co-estimates the species tree and gene trees given sequence alignments on multiple loci, has generally been shown to have the best accuracy. However, *BEAST is extremely computationally intensive so that it cannot be used with large numbers of loci; hence, *BEAST is not suitable for genome-scale analyses.

RESULTS: We present BBCA (boosted binned coalescent-based analysis), a method that can be used with *BEAST (and other such co-estimation methods) to improve scalability. BBCA partitions the loci randomly into subsets, uses *BEAST on each subset to co-estimate the gene trees and species tree for the subset, and then combines the newly estimated gene trees together using MP-EST, a popular coalescent-based summary method. We compare time-restricted versions of BBCA and *BEAST on simulated datasets, and show that BBCA is at least as accurate as *BEAST, and achieves better convergence rates for large numbers of loci.

CONCLUSIONS: Phylogenomic analysis using *BEAST is currently limited to datasets with a small number of loci, and analyses with even just 100 loci can be computationally challenging. BBCA uses a very simple divide-and-conquer approach that makes it possible to use *BEAST on datasets containing hundreds of loci. This study shows that BBCA provides excellent accuracy and is highly scalable.},

This protocol introduces the procedures for building a phylogenetic tree of a large number of microbial genomes using a broad sampling of marker genes that are representative of whole-genome evolution. The protocol highlights the use of a gene tree summary method, which can effectively reconstruct the species tree while accounting for the topological conflicts among individual gene trees. The pipeline described in this protocol is scalable to tens of thousands of genomes while retaining high accuracy. We discussed multiple software tools, libraries, and scripts to enable convenient adoption of the protocol.

To this end, summary methods have been developed to allow accurate and scalable inference of species trees from gene trees. However, most of these methods, including the widely used ASTRAL, can only handle single-copy gene trees and do not attempt to model gene duplication and gene loss. As a result, most phylogenomic studies have focused on single-copy genes and have discarded large parts of the data. Here, we first propose a measure of quartet similarity between single-copy and multicopy trees that accounts for orthology and paralogy. We then introduce a method called ASTRAL-Pro (ASTRAL for PaRalogs and Orthologs) to find the species tree that optimizes our quartet similarity measure using dynamic programing. By studying its performance on an extensive collection of simulated data sets and on real data sets, we show that ASTRAL-Pro is more accurate than alternative methods.},

ASTRAL is a leading method for inferring species trees given gene trees while accounting for incomplete lineage sorting. It finds the tree that shares the maximum number of quartets with input trees, drawing bipartitions from a predefined set of bipartitions X. In this paper, we introduce ASTRAL-III, which substantially improves on ASTRAL-II in terms of running time by handling polytomies more efficiently, exploiting similarities between gene trees, and trimming unnecessary parts of the search space. The asymptotic running time in the presence of polytomies is reduced from \$\$O(n{\textasciicircum}3k{\textbar}X{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}\{\{1.726\}\})\$\$ for n species and k genes to \$\$O(D{\textbar}X{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}\{1.726\})\$\$ where \$\$D=O(nk)\$\$ is the sum of degrees of all unique nodes in input trees. ASTRAL-III enables us to test whether contracting low support branches in gene trees improves the accuracy by reducing noise. In extensive simulations and on real data, we show that removing branches with very low support improves accuracy while overly aggressive filtering is harmful.},

As more high-quality genomes become available, we urgently need discordance-aware methods to infer the tree directly from a multiple genome alignment. Here, we introduce CASTER, a theoretically justified site-based method that eliminates the need to predefine recombination-free loci. CASTER is scalable to hundreds of mammalian whole genomes. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of CASTER in simulations that include recombination and apply CASTER to several biological datasets, showing that its per-site scores can reveal both biological and artefactual patterns of discordance across the genome.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Phylogenomic analyses routinely estimate species trees using methods that account for gene tree discordance. However, the most scalable species tree inference methods, which summarize independently inferred gene trees to obtain a species tree, are sensitive to hard-to-avoid errors introduced in the gene tree estimation step. This dilemma has created much debate on the merits of concatenation versus summary methods and practical obstacles to using summary methods more widely and to the exclusion of concatenation. The most successful attempt at making summary methods resilient to noisy gene trees has been contracting low support branches from the gene trees. Unfortunately, this approach requires arbitrary thresholds and poses new challenges. Here, we introduce threshold-free weighting schemes for the quartet-based species tree inference, the metric used in the popular method ASTRAL. By reducing the impact of quartets with low support or long terminal branches (or both), weighting provides stronger theoretical guarantees and better empirical performance than the unweighted ASTRAL. Our simulations show that weighting improves accuracy across many conditions and reduces the gap with concatenation in conditions with low gene tree discordance and high noise. On empirical data, weighting improves congruence with concatenation and increases support. Together, our results show that weighting, enabled by a new optimization algorithm we introduce, improves the utility of summary methods and can reduce the incongruence often observed across analytical pipelines.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Affinity maturation (AM) of B cells through somatic hypermutations (SHMs) enables the immune system to evolve to recognize diverse pathogens. The accumulation of SHMs leads to the formation of clonal lineages of antibody-secreting b cells that have evolved from a common naïve B cell. Advances in high-throughput sequencing have enabled deep scans of B cell receptor repertoires, paving the way for reconstructing clonal trees. However, it is not clear if clonal trees, which capture microevolutionary time scales, can be reconstructed using traditional phylogenetic reconstruction methods with adequate accuracy. In fact, several clonal tree reconstruction methods have been developed to fix supposed shortcomings of phylogenetic methods. Nevertheless, no consensus has been reached regarding the relative accuracy of these methods, partially because evaluation is challenging. Benchmarking the performance of existing methods and developing better methods would both benefit from realistic models of clonal lineage evolution specifically designed for emulating B cell evolution. In this paper, we propose a model for modeling B cell clonal lineage evolution and use this model to benchmark several existing clonal tree reconstruction methods. Our model, designed to be extensible, has several features: by evolving the clonal tree and sequences simultaneously, it allows modeling selective pressure due to changes in affinity binding; it enables scalable simulations of large numbers of cells; it enables several rounds of infection by an evolving pathogen; and, it models building of memory. In addition, we also suggest a set of metrics for comparing clonal trees and measuring their properties. Our results show that while maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction methods can fail to capture key features of clonal tree expansion if applied naively, a simple post-processing of their results, where short branches are contracted, leads to inferences that are better than alternative methods.},

	abstract = {SignificanceEarly branching events in the diversification of land plants and closely related algal lineages remain fundamental and unresolved questions in plant evolutionary biology. Accurate reconstructions of these relationships are critical for testing hypotheses of character evolution: for example, the origins of the embryo, vascular tissue, seeds, and flowers. We investigated relationships among streptophyte algae and land plants using the largest set of nuclear genes that has been applied to this problem to date. Hypothesized relationships were rigorously tested through a series of analyses to assess systematic errors in phylogenetic inference caused by sampling artifacts and model misspecification. Results support some generally accepted phylogenetic hypotheses, while rejecting others. This work provides a new framework for studies of land plant evolution. Reconstructing the origin and evolution of land plants and their algal relatives is a fundamental problem in plant phylogenetics, and is essential for understanding how critical adaptations arose, including the embryo, vascular tissue, seeds, and flowers. Despite advances in molecular systematics, some hypotheses of relationships remain weakly resolved. Inferring deep phylogenies with bouts of rapid diversification can be problematic; however, genome-scale data should significantly increase the number of informative characters for analyses. Recent phylogenomic reconstructions focused on the major divergences of plants have resulted in promising but inconsistent results. One limitation is sparse taxon sampling, likely resulting from the difficulty and cost of data generation. To address this limitation, transcriptome data for 92 streptophyte taxa were generated and analyzed along with 11 published plant genome sequences. Phylogenetic reconstructions were conducted using up to 852 nuclear genes and 1,701,170 aligned sites. Sixty-nine analyses were performed to test the robustness of phylogenetic inferences to permutations of the data matrix or to phylogenetic method, including supermatrix, supertree, and coalescent-based approaches, maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods, partitioned and unpartitioned analyses, and amino acid versus DNA alignments. Among other results, we find robust support for a sister-group relationship between land plants and one group of streptophyte green algae, the Zygnematophyceae. Strong and robust support for a clade comprising liverworts and mosses is inconsistent with a widely accepted view of early land plant evolution, and suggests that phylogenetic hypotheses used to understand the evolution of fundamental plant traits should be reevaluated.},

Here we present a meta-analysis of microbial community samples collected by hundreds of researchers for the Earth Microbiome Project. Coordinated protocols and new analytical methods, particularly the use of exact sequences instead of clustered operational taxonomic units, enable bacterial and archaeal ribosomal RNA gene sequences to be followed across multiple studies and allow us to explore patterns of diversity at an unprecedented scale.

              Motivation
              Branch lengths and topology of a species tree are essential in most downstream analyses, including estimation of diversification dates, characterization of selection, understanding adaptation, and comparative genomics. Modern phylogenomic analyses often use methods that account for the heterogeneity of evolutionary histories across the genome due to processes such as incomplete lineage sorting. However, these methods typically do not generate branch lengths in units that are usable by downstream applications, forcing phylogenomic analyses to resort to alternative shortcuts such as estimating branch lengths by concatenating gene alignments into a supermatrix. Yet, concatenation and other available approaches for estimating branch lengths fail to address heterogeneity across the genome.
            
            
              Results
              In this article, we derive expected values of gene tree branch lengths in substitution units under an extension of the multispecies coalescent (MSC) model that allows substitutions with varying rates across the species tree. We present CASTLES, a new technique for estimating branch lengths on the species tree from estimated gene trees that uses these expected values, and our study shows that CASTLES improves on the most accurate prior methods with respect to both speed and accuracy.

	abstract = {Phylogenetic branch lengths are essential for many analyses, such as estimating divergence times, analyzing rate changes, and studying adaptation. However, true gene tree heterogeneity due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), gene duplication and loss (GDL), and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can complicate the estimation of species tree branch lengths. While several tools exist for estimating the topology of a species tree addressing various causes of gene tree discordance, much less attention has been paid to branch length estimation on multi-locus datasets. For single-copy gene trees, some methods are available that summarize gene tree branch lengths onto a species tree, including coalescent-based methods that account for heterogeneity due to ILS. However, no such branch length estimation method exists for multi-copy gene family trees that have evolved with gene duplication and loss. To address this gap, we introduce the CASTLES-Pro algorithm for estimating species tree branch lengths while accounting for both GDL and ILS. CASTLES-Pro improves on the existing coalescent-based branch length estimation method CASTLES by increasing its accuracy for single-copy gene trees and extends it to handle multi-copy ones. Our simulation studies show that CASTLES-Pro is generally more accurate than alternatives, eliminating the systematic bias toward overestimating terminal branch lengths often observed when using concatenation. Moreover, while not theoretically designed for HGT, we show that CASTLES-Pro maintains relatively high accuracy under high rates of random HGT. Code availability: CASTLES-Pro is implemented inside the software package ASTER, available at https://github.com/chaoszhang/ASTER.

	abstract = {Species trees need to be dated for many downstream applications. Typical molecular dating methods take a phylogenetic tree with branch lengths in substitution units as well as a set of calibrations as input and convert the branch lengths of the species tree to the unit of time while being consistent with the pre-specified calibrations. When dating species trees from multi-locus genome-scale datasets, the branch lengths and sometimes the topology of the species tree are estimated using concatenation. However, concatenation does not address gene tree heterogeneity across the genome. While Bayesian dating methods can address some forms of gene tree heterogeneity, such as incomplete lineage sorting, they are not scalable to large datasets. In this paper, we introduce a new scalable pipeline for dating species trees that addresses gene tree discordance for both topology and branch length estimation. The pipeline uses discordance-aware methods that account for incomplete lineage sorting for estimating the topology and branch lengths and maximum likelihood-based methods for the dating step. Our simulation study on datasets with gene tree discordance shows that this pipeline produces more accurate and less biased dates than pipelines that use concatenation or unpartitioned Bayesian methods. Furthermore, it is substantially more scalable and can handle datasets with thousands of species and genes. Our results on two biological datasets show that this new pipeline improves the inference of node ages and branch lengths for some nodes, in particular extant taxa, and improves the downstream diversification analysis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {A fundamental step in any comparative whole genome analysis is the annotation of homology relationships between segments of the genomes. Traditionally, this annotation has been based on coding segments, where orthologous genes are inferred and then syntenic blocks are computed by agglomerating sets of homologous genes into homologous regions. More recently, whole genomes, including intergenic regions, are being aligned de novo as whole genome alignments (WGA). In this article we develop a test to measure to what extent sets of homology relationships given by two different software are hierarchically related to one another, where matched segments from one software may contain matched segments from the other and vice versa. Such a test should be used as a sanity check for an agglomerative syntenic block software, and provides a mapping between the blocks that can be used for further downstream analyses. We show that, in practice, it is rare that two collections of homology relationships are perfectly hierarchically related. Therefore we present an optimization problem to measure how far they are from being so. We show that this problem, which is a generalization of the assignment problem, is NP-Hard and give a heuristic solution and implementation. We apply our distance measure to data from the Alignathon competition, as well as to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, showing that many factors affect how hierarchically related two collections are, including sensitivities to guide trees and the use or omission of an outgroup. These findings inform practitioners on the pitfalls of homology relationship inference, and can inform development of more robust inference tools.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Scientists rarely reuse expert knowledge of phylogeny, in spite of years of effort to assemble a great "Tree of Life" (ToL). A notable exception involves the use of Phylomatic, which provides tools to generate custom phylogenies from a large, pre-computed, expert phylogeny of plant taxa. This suggests great potential for a more generalized system that, starting with a query consisting of a list of any known species, would rectify non-standard names, identify expert phylogenies containing the implicated taxa, prune away unneeded parts, and supply branch lengths and annotations, resulting in a custom phylogeny suited to the user's needs. Such a system could become a sustainable community resource if implemented as a distributed system of loosely coupled parts that interact through clearly defined interfaces. RESULTS: With the aim of building such a "phylotastic" system, the NESCent Hackathons, Interoperability, Phylogenies (HIP) working group recruited 2 dozen scientist-programmers to a weeklong programming hackathon in June 2012. During the hackathon (and a three-month follow-up period), 5 teams produced designs, implementations, documentation, presentations, and tests including: (1) a generalized scheme for integrating components; (2) proof-of-concept pruners and controllers; (3) a meta-API for taxonomic name resolution services; (4) a system for storing, finding, and retrieving phylogenies using semantic web technologies for data exchange, storage, and querying; (5) an innovative new service, DateLife.org, which synthesizes pre-computed, time-calibrated phylogenies to assign ages to nodes; and (6) demonstration projects. These outcomes are accessible via a public code repository (GitHub.com), a website (http://www.phylotastic.org), and a server image. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 9 person-months of effort (centered on a software development hackathon) resulted in the design and implementation of proof-of-concept software for 4 core phylotastic components, 3 controllers, and 3 end-user demonstration tools. While these products have substantial limitations, they suggest considerable potential for a distributed system that makes phylogenetic knowledge readily accessible in computable form. Widespread use of phylotastic systems will create an electronic marketplace for sharing phylogenetic knowledge that will spur innovation in other areas of the ToL enterprise, such as annotation of sources and methods and third-party methods of quality assessment.},

We also validate those theoretical bounds in a simulation study. Our results indicate that ASTRAL requires \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(f{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} {\textbackslash}log n)\$ gene trees to reconstruct the species tree correctly with high probability where n is the number of species and f is the length of the shortest branch in the species tree.

	abstract = {Although horizontal gene transfer is recognized as a major evolutionary process in Bacteria and Archaea, its general patterns remain elusive, due to difficulties tracking genes at relevant resolution and scale within complex microbiomes. To circumvent these challenges, we analyzed a randomized sample of \&amp;gt;12,000 genomes of individual cells of Bacteria and Archaea in the tropical and subtropical ocean - a well-mixed, global environment. We found that marine microorganisms form gene exchange networks (GENs) within which transfers of both flexible and core genes are frequent, including the rRNA operon that is commonly used as a conservative taxonomic marker. The data revealed efficient gene exchange among genomes with \&amp;lt;28\% nucleotide difference, indicating that GENs are much broader lineages than the nominal microbial species, which are currently delineated at 4-6\% nucleotide difference. The 42 largest GENs accounted for 90\% of cells in the tropical ocean microbiome. Frequent gene exchange within GENs helps explain how marine microorganisms maintain millions of rare genes and adapt to a dynamic environment despite extreme genome streamlining of their individual cells. Our study suggests that sharing of pangenomes through horizontal gene transfer is a defining feature of fundamental evolutionary units in marine planktonic microorganisms and, potentially, other microbiomes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Interpretive ways of measuring and visualizing discordance are needed, both among alternative species trees and gene trees, especially for specific focal branches of a tree. Here, we introduce DiscoVista, a publicly available tool that creates a suite of simple but interpretable visualizations. DiscoVista helps quantify the amount of discordance and some of its potential causes.},

	abstract = {Species tree reconstruction from genome-wide data is increasingly being attempted, in most cases using a two-step approach of first estimating individual gene trees and then summarizing them to obtain a species tree. The accuracy of this approach, which promises to account for gene tree discordance, depends on the quality of the inferred gene trees. At the same time, phylogenomic and phylotranscriptomic analyses typically use involved bioinformatics pipelines for data preparation. Errors and shortcomings resulting from these preprocessing steps may impact the species tree analyses at the other end of the pipeline. In this article, we first show that the presence of fragmentary data for some species in a gene alignment, as often seen on real data, can result in substantial deterioration of gene trees, and as a result, the species tree. We then investigate a simple filtering strategy where individual fragmentary sequences are removed from individual genes but the rest of the gene is retained. Both in simulations and by reanalyzing a large insect phylotranscriptomic dataset, we show the effectiveness of this simple filtering strategy.},

While there has been substantial progress in developing methods that estimate a species tree given a collection of gene trees, less attention has been paid to fast and accurate methods of quantifying support. In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm to compute quartet-based support for each branch of a given species tree with regard to a given set of gene trees. We then show how the quartet support can be used in the context of the multi-species coalescent model to compute i) the local posterior probability that the branch is in the species tree and ii) the length of the branch in coalescent units. We evaluate the precision and recall of the local posterior probability on a wide set of simulated and biological datasets, and show that it has very high precision and improved recall compared to multi-locus bootstrapping. The estimated branch lengths are highly accurate when gene tree estimation error is low, but are underestimated when gene tree estimation error increases. Computation of both the branch length and the local posterior probability is implemented as new features in ASTRAL.},

However, polytomies in the species tree cannot be detected or ruled out without considering gene tree discordance. In this paper, we describe a statistical test based on properties of the multi-species coalescent model to test the null hypothesis that a branch in an estimated species tree should be replaced by a polytomy. On both simulated and biological datasets, we show that the null hypothesis is rejected for all but the shortest branches, and in most cases, it is retained for true polytomies.

              Motivation
              Taxonomic classification of short reads and taxonomic profiling of metagenomic samples are well-studied yet challenging problems. The presence of species belonging to ranks without close representation in a reference dataset is particularly challenging. While k-mer-based methods have performed well in terms of running time and accuracy, they tend to have reduced accuracy for such novel species. Thus, there is a growing need for methods that combine the scalability of k-merswith increased sensitivity.
            
            
              Results
              Here, we show that using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) can increase the sensitivity of the k-mer-based search. Our method, which combines LSH with several heuristics techniques including soft LCA labeling and voting is, more accurate than alternatives in both taxonomic classification of individual reads and abundance profiling.

	abstract = {The cost of sequencing the genome is dropping at a much faster rate compared to assembling and finishing the genome. The use of lightly sampled genomes (genome-skims) could be transformative for genomic ecology, and results using k -mers have shown the advantage of this approach in identification and phylogenetic placement of eukaryotic species. Here, we revisit the basic question of estimating genomic parameters such as genome length, coverage, and repeat structure, focusing specifically on estimating the k -mer repeat spectrum. We show using a mix of theoretical and empirical analysis that there are fundamental limitations to estimating the k -mer spectra due to ill-conditioned systems, and that has implications for other genomic parameters. We get around this problem using a novel constrained optimization approach (Spline Linear Programming), where the constraints are learned empirically. On reads simulated at 1X coverage from 66 genomes, our method, REPeat SPECTra Estimation (RESPECT), had 2.2\% error in length estimation compared to 27\% error previously achieved. In shotgun sequenced read samples with contaminants, RESPECT length estimates had median error 4\%, in contrast to other methods that had median error 80\%. Together, the results suggest that low-pass genomic sequencing can yield reliable estimates of the length and repeat content of the genome.

	abstract = {The ability to quickly and inexpensively describe the taxonomic diversity in an environment is critical in this era of rapid climate and biodiversity changes. The currently preferred molecular technique, barcoding, is low-cost and widely used, but has drawbacks. As sequencing costs continue to fall, an alternative approach based on genome-skimming has been proposed [1, 2]. This approach first applies low-pass (100 Mb – several Gb per sample) sequencing to voucher and/or query samples and then recovers marker genes and/or organelle genomes computationally. In contrast, we suggest the use of the unassembled sequence data for taxonomic identification using an alignment-free approach based on the k-mer decomposition of the sequencing reads. Specifically, we first estimate the average sequencing depth and error rate for each genome skim, by comparing our derived theoretical distribution of k-mers’ multiplicity and the histogram of k-mer counts computed using Jellyfish [3] . The genome length is also estimated from the average sequencing depth accordingly. Then, the similarity of two genome skims is measured by the Jaccard index between their corresponding k-mer collections. Finally, the hamming distance between genomes is estimated from the Jaccard index, using the following formula obtained by modeling the impact of low sequencing coverage, sequencing error, and differing genome lengths on the similarity of genome skims: D 1/k2(ζ1 L 1 + ζ 2 L 2 )J D = 1 ™. η 1 η 2 (L 1 + L 2 )(1 + J) In this equation, when coverage is low, we use all k-mers and set: η i = 1 ™ e ™ci(1™k/ℓ)(1™ɛi)k , ζ i = η i + c i (1 ™ k/ℓ)(1 ™ (1 ™ ɛ i ) k ). For higher coverages, we remove k-mers with multiplicity below a threshold m, and set: m™1 ∑ (c i (1 ™ k/ℓ)(1 ™ ɛ i ) k ) t ζ i = η i = 1 ™ e ™ci(1™k/ℓ)(1™ɛi)k . t! t=0 In these equations, k and ℓ are k-mer and read length, respectively, and c i , ɛ i , and L i are substituted from the estimates of coverage, error rate, and genome length for each genome skim. The Jaccard index between two genome skims, J, is computed by Mash [4] efficiently using a hashing technique. We have tested our tool, Skmer, on genome skims simulated from assemblies of 90 species from two genera of insects (Anopheles and Drosophila) and across the avian tree of life. We test the accuracy of the distances computed by Skmer, and subsequently use the distances to find the exact/closest match to a query sample in a reference set of genome skims. Comparing to the other k-mer based tools, Skmer shows excellent performance in our simulation studies, especially when the coverage is below 4X [5] . Skmer makes the assembly-free approach to genome-skimming a viable alternative to the traditional barcoding. The software is made publicly available on Github (https://github.com/shahab-sarmashghi/Skmer.git).},

	abstract = {Metagenomics is widely used to study the microbiome using environmental samples, and taxonomic classification of reads is a precursor to many analyses of such data. Taxonomic classification requires comparing sample reads against a reference dataset of known organisms. Crucially, the genomes represented in a sample may be phylogenetically distant from their closest match in the reference set. Thus, simply mapping reads to genomes is insufficient; we need to find inexact matches to species with substantial distance. While k-mer-based methods, such as Kraken, have proved popular, they have limited ability to match against distant taxa. In this paper, we use locality sensitive hashing to design a k-mer-based method that can match reads to genomes with higher distance than existing methods. We build on an earlier contamination detection method, CONSULT, to add taxonomic classification abilities. We show in a series of experiments that our method, CONSULT-II, has higher recall than alternatives when precision is about the same. Its results can also be summarized to obtain a taxonomic profile, which we show outperforms leading methods with respect to some measurement criteria.

	abstract = {Consider comparing a sequencing read of unknown origin to a set of reference genomes. This problem underlines many applications, including metagenomic analyses. The exact genome generating the read is not in the reference set, but may be evolutionarily related to some references. Ideally, we need not just the identity of the closest references to the read but also their distance to the read. The distances can help us identify the read at the right taxonomic level and, more ambitiously, place it on a reference phylogeny. Aligning reads to reference genomes, the only available approach for computing such distances, becomes impractical for very large reference sets. It is also not effective at higher distances when used with efficient indexes (e.g., Bowtie2). While k-mers can create scalable indexes, existing k-mer-based methods are incapable of distance calculation. Thus, estimating distances between short reads and large, diverse reference sets remains challenging and seldom used. We introduce a method called krepp that combines four ideas to solve this challenge and to further enable placing reads on a reference phylogeny. We use i) locality-sensitive hashing to find inexact k-mer matches, ii) a phylogeny-guided colored k-mer index to map each k-mer to all references containing it, iii) a maximum likelihood framework to estimate read-genome distances using k-mer matches, and iv) an extension of distances to clades of the reference tree, which enables placement using a likelihood ratio test. We show that krepp matches true distances using a fraction of time compared to alignment, extends to higher distances, and accurately places short reads coming from any part of the genome (not just marker genes) on the reference phylogeny. We demonstrate easily extends to databases with tens of thousands of reference genomes and performs well in characterizing real microbial samples.

Thanks to the falling price of shotgun sequencing, genome skimming, the acquisition of short reads spread across the genome at low coverage, is emerging as an alternative to traditional barcoding. By obtaining far more data across the whole genome, skimming has the promise to increase the precision of sample identification beyond traditional barcoding while keeping the costs manageable. While methods for assembly-free sample identification based on genome skims are now available, little is known about how these methods react to the presence of DNA from organisms other than the target species. In this paper, we show that the accuracy of distances computed between a pair of genome skims based on k-mer similarity can degrade dramatically if the skims include contaminant reads; i.e., any reads originating from other organisms. We establish a theoretical model of the impact of contamination. We then suggest and evaluate a solution to the contamination problem: Query reads in a genome skim against an extensive database of possible contaminants (e.g., all microbial organisms) and filter out any read that matches. We evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy when implemented using Kraken-II, in detailed analyses. Our results show substantial improvements in accuracy as a result of filtering but also point to limitations, including a need for relatively close matches in the contaminant database.},

	abstract = {A fundamental question appears in many bioinformatics applications: Does a sequencing read belong to a large dataset of genomes from some broad taxonomic group, even when the closest match in the set is evolutionarily divergent from the query? For example, low-coverage genome sequencing (skimming) projects either assemble the organelle genome or compute genomic distances directly from unassembled reads. Using unassembled reads needs contamination detection because samples often include reads from unintended groups of species. Similarly, assembling the organelle genome needs distinguishing organelle and nuclear reads. While k-mer-based methods have shown promise in read-matching, prior studies have shown that existing methods are insufficiently sensitive for contamination detection. Here, we introduce a new read-matching tool called CONSULT that tests whether k-mers from a query fall within a user-specified distance of the reference dataset using locality-sensitive hashing. Taking advantage of large memory machines available nowadays, CONSULT libraries accommodate tens of thousands of microbial species. Our results show that CONSULT has higher true-positive and lower false-positive rates of contamination detection than leading methods such as Kraken-II and improves distance calculation from genome skims. We also demonstrate that CONSULT can distinguish organelle reads from nuclear reads, leading to dramatic improvements in skim-based mitochondrial assemblies.},

              -mers to find sequence matches is increasingly used in many bioinformatic applications, including metagenomic sequence classification. The accuracy of these downstream applications relies on the density of the reference databases, which are rapidly growing. While the increased density provides hope for dramatic improvements in accuracy, scalability is a concern. The
              k
              -mers are kept in the memory during the query time, and saving all
              k
              -mers of these ever-expanding databases is fast becoming impractical. Several strategies for subsampling
              k
              -mers have been proposed, including minimizers and finding taxon-specific
              k
              -mers. However, we contend that these strategies are inadequate, especially when reference sets are taxonomically imbalanced, as are most microbial libraries. In this paper, we explore approaches for selecting a fixed-size subset of
              k
              -mers present in an ultra-large dataset to include in a library such that the classification of reads suffers the least. Our experiments demonstrate the limitations of existing approaches, especially for novel and poorly sampled groups. We propose a library construction algorithm called KRANK (
              K
              -mer RANKer) that combines several components, including a hierarchical selection strategy with adaptive size restrictions and an equitable coverage strategy. We implement KRANK in highly optimized code and combine it with the locality-sensitive-hashing classifier CONSULT-II to build a taxonomic classification and profiling method. On several benchmarks, KRANK
              k
              -mer selection dramatically reduces memory consumption with minimal loss in classification accuracy. We show in extensive analyses based on CAMI benchmarks that KRANK outperforms
              k
              -mer-based alternatives in terms of taxonomic profiling and comes close to the best marker-based methods in terms of accuracy.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide phylogeny reconstruction is becoming increasingly common, and one driving factor behind these phylogenomic studies is the promise that the potential discordance between gene trees and the species tree can be modeled. Incomplete lineage sorting is one cause of discordance that bridges population genetic and phylogenetic processes. ASTRAL is a species tree reconstruction method that seeks to find the tree with minimum quartet distance to an input set of inferred gene trees. However, the published ASTRAL algorithm only works with one sample per species. To account for polymorphisms in present-day species, one can sample multiple individuals per species to create multi-allele datasets. Here, we introduce how ASTRAL can handle multi-allele datasets. We show that the quartet-based optimization problem extends naturally, and we introduce heuristic methods for building the search space specifically for the case of multi-individual datasets. We study the accuracy and scalability of the multi-individual version of ASTRAL-III using extensive simulation studies and compare it to NJst, the only other scalable method that can handle these datasets. We do not find strong evidence that using multiple individuals dramatically improves accuracy. When we study the trade-off between sampling more genes versus more individuals, we find that sampling more genes is more effective than sampling more individuals, even under conditions that we study where trees are shallow (median length: ≈ 1Ne) and ILS is extremely high.},

Species delimitation is closely related to species tree inference from discordant gene trees, a problem that has enjoyed rapid advances in recent years. A major advance has been the surprising accuracy and scalability of methods that rely on breaking gene trees into quartets of leaves. In this paper, we build on this success and propose a new method called SODA for species delimitation.

Background: Given a new biological sequence, detecting membership in a known family is a basic step in many bioinformatics analyses, with applications to protein structure and function prediction and metagenomic taxon identification and abundance profiling, among others. Yet family identification of sequences that are distantly related to sequences in public databases or that are fragmentary remains one of the more difficult analytical problems in bioinformatics. Results: We present a new technique for family identification called HIPPI (Hierarchical Profile Hidden Markov Models for Protein family Identification). HIPPI uses a novel technique to represent a multiple sequence alignment for a given protein family or superfamily by an ensemble of profile hidden Markov models computed using HMMER. An evaluation of HIPPI on the Pfam database shows that HIPPI has better overall precision and recall than blastp, HMMER, and pipelines based on HHsearch, and maintains good accuracy even for fragmentary query sequences  and for protein families with low average pairwise sequence identity, both conditions where other methods degrade in accuracy. Conclusion: HIPPI provides accurate protein family identification and is robust to difficult model conditions. Our results, combined with observations from previous studies, show that ensembles of profile Hidden Markov models can better represent multiple sequence alignments than a single profile Hidden Markov model, and thus can improve downstream analyses for various bioinformatic tasks. Further research is needed to determine the best practices for building the ensemble of profile Hidden Markov models. HIPPI is available on GitHub at https://github.com/smirarab/sepp.},

	abstract = {In HIV epidemics, the structure of the transmission network can be dictated by just a few individuals. Public health intervention, such as ensuring people living with HIV adhere to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and are continually virally-suppressed, can help control the spread of the virus. However, such intervention requires utilizing the limited public health resource allocations. As a result, the ability to determine which individuals are most at-risk of transmitting HIV could allow public health officials to focus their limited resources on these individuals. Molecular epidemiology suggests an approach: prioritizing people living with HIV based on patterns of transmission inferred from their sampled viral sequences. In this paper, we introduce ProACT (Prioritization using AnCesTral edge lengths), a phylogenetic approach for prioritizing individuals living with HIV. ProACT uses a simple idea: ordering individuals by their terminal branch length in the phylogeny of their virus. In simulations and also on a dataset of HIV-1 subtype B pol sequences obtained in San Diego, we show that this simple strategy improves the effectiveness of prioritization compared to state-of-the-art methods that rely on monitoring the growth of transmission clusters defined based on genetic distance.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Supertree methods combine trees on subsets of the full taxon set together to produce a tree on the entire set of taxa. Of the many supertree methods, the most popular is MRP (Matrix Representation with Parsimony), a method that operates by first encoding the input set of source trees by a large matrix (the "MRP matrix") over \{0,1,?\}, and then running maximum parsimony heuristics on the MRP matrix. Experimental studies evaluating MRP in comparison to other supertree methods have established that for large datasets, MRP generally produces trees of equal or greater accuracy than other methods, and can run on larger datasets. A recent development in supertree methods is SuperFine+MRP, a method that combines MRP with a divide-and-conquer approach, and produces more accurate trees in less time than MRP. In this paper we consider a new approach for supertree estimation, called MRL (Matrix Representation with Likelihood). MRL begins with the same MRP matrix, but then analyzes the MRP matrix using heuristics (such as RAxML) for 2-state Maximum Likelihood. RESULTS: We compared MRP and SuperFine+MRP with MRL and SuperFine+MRL on simulated and biological datasets. We examined the MRP and MRL scores of each method on a wide range of datasets, as well as the resulting topological accuracy of the trees. Our experimental results show that MRL, coupled with a very good ML heuristic such as RAxML, produced more accurate trees than MRP, and MRL scores were more strongly correlated with topological accuracy than MRP scores. CONCLUSIONS: SuperFine+MRP when based upon a good MRP heuristic such as TNT, produces among the best scores for both MRP and MRL, and is generally faster and more topologically accurate than other supertree methods we tested.},

Results: We introduce FAVITES, a robust framework for simulating realistic datasets for epidemics that are caused by fast-evolving pathogens like HIV. FAVITES creates a generative model that produces many items relevant to an epidemic, such as contact networks, transmission networks, phylogenetic trees, and error-prone sequence datasets. FAVITES is designed to be flexible and exhaustive by dividing the generative model into modules, each of which is expressed as a fixed API that can be implemented using various sub-models. We use FAVITES to simulate HIV datasets resembling the San Diego epidemic and show that the simulated datasets are realistic. We then use the simulated data to make inferences about the epidemic and how it is impact by increased treatment efforts. We also study two transmission network reconstruction methods and their effectiveness in detecting fast-growing clusters.},

Motivation: The estimation of species phylogenies requires multiple loci, since different loci can have different trees due to incomplete lineage sorting, modeled by the multi-species coalescent model. We recently developed a coalescent-based method, ASTRAL, which is statistically consistent under the multi-species coalescent model and which is more accurate than other coalescent-based methods on the datasets we examined. ASTRAL runs in polynomial time, by constraining the search space using a set of allowed 'bipartitions'. Despite the limitation to allowed bipartitions, ASTRAL is statistically consistent. Results: We present a new version of ASTRAL, which we call ASTRAL-II. We show that ASTRAL-II has substantial advantages over ASTRAL: it is faster, can analyze much larger datasets (up to 1000 species and 1000 genes) and has substantially better accuracy under some conditions. ASTRAL's running time is O(n2k{\textbar}X{\textbar}2), and ASTRAL-II's running time is O(nk{\textbar}X{\textbar}2), where n is the number of species, k is the number of loci and X is the set of allowed bipartitions for the search space.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Multiple sequence alignment is a basic part of much biological research, including phylogeny estimation and protein structure and function prediction. Different alignments on the same set of unaligned sequences are often compared, sometimes in order to assess the accuracy of alignment methods or to infer a consensus alignment from a set of estimated alignments. Three of the standard techniques for comparing alignments, Developer, Modeler and Total Column (TC) scores can be derived through calculations of the set of homologies that the alignments share. However, the brute-force technique for calculating this set is quadratic in the input size. The remaining standard technique, Cline Shift Score, inherently requires quadratic time.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: In this article, we prove that each of these scores can be computed in linear time, and we present FastSP, a linear-time algorithm for calculating these scores. Even on the largest alignments we explored (one with 50 000 sequences), FastSP completed {\textless}2 min and used at most 2 GB of the main memory. The best alternative is qscore, a method whose empirical running time is approximately the same as FastSP when given sufficient memory (at least 8 GB), but whose asymptotic running time has never been theoretically established. In addition, for comparisons of large alignments under lower memory conditions (at most 4 GB of main memory), qscore uses substantial memory (up to 10 GB for the datasets we studied), took more time and failed to analyze the largest datasets.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nAVAILABILITY: The open-source software and executables are available online at http://www.cs.utexas.edu/{\textasciitilde}phylo/software/fastsp/.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONTACT: tandy@cs.utexas.edu.},

We have previously introduced a new approach for test case prioritization using Bayesian Networks (BN) which integrates different types of information to estimate the probability of each test case finding bugs [12] . In this paper, we enhance our BN-based approach in two ways. First, we introduce a feedback mechanism and a new change information gathering strategy. Second, a comprehensive empirical study is performed to evaluate the performance of the approach and to identify the effects of using different parameters included in the technique. The study is performed on five open source Java objects. The obtained results show relative advantage of using feedback mechanism for some objects in terms of early fault detection. They also provide insight into costs and benefits of the various parameters used in the approach. © 2008 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Genomes are typically mosaics of regions with different evolutionary histories. When speciation events are closely spaced in time, recombination makes the regions sharing the same history small, and the evolutionary history changes rapidly as we move along the genome. When examining rapid radiations such as the early diversification of Neoaves 66 Mya, typically no consistent history is observed across segments exceeding kilobases of the genome. Here, we report an exception. We found that a 21-Mb region in avian genomes, mapped to chicken chromosome 4, shows an extremely strong and discordance-free signal for a history different from that of the inferred species tree. Such a strong discordance-free signal, indicative of suppressed recombination across many millions of base pairs, is not observed elsewhere in the genome for any deep avian relationships. Although long regions with suppressed recombination have been documented in recently diverged species, our results pertain to relationships dating circa 65 Mya. We provide evidence that this strong signal may be due to an ancient rearrangement that blocked recombination and remained polymorphic for several million years prior to fixation. We show that the presence of this region has misled previous phylogenomic efforts with lower taxon sampling, showing the interplay between taxon and locus sampling. We predict that similar ancient rearrangements may confound phylogenetic analyses in other clades, pointing to a need for new analytical models that incorporate the possibility of such events.},

Yet, gene trees often differ from species trees, creating challenges to species tree estimation. One of the most frequent causes for conflicting topologies between gene trees and species trees is incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), which is modelled by the multi-species coalescent. While many methods have been developed to estimate species trees from multiple genes, some which have statistical guarantees under the multi-species coalescent model, existing methods are too computationally intensive for use with genome-scale analyses or have been shown to have poor accuracy under some realistic conditions.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: We present ASTRAL, a fast method for estimating species trees from multiple genes. ASTRAL is statistically consistent, can run on datasets with thousands of genes and has outstanding accuracy-improving on MP-EST and the population tree from BUCKy, two statistically consistent leading coalescent-based methods. ASTRAL is often more accurate than concatenation using maximum likelihood, except when ILS levels are low or there are too few gene trees.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: ASTRAL is available in open source form at https://github.com/smirarab/ASTRAL/.

	abstract = {We address the problem of Phylogenetic Placement, in which the objective is to insert short molecular sequences (called query sequences) into an existing phylogenetic tree and alignment on full-length sequences for the same gene. Phylogenetic placement has the potential to provide information beyond pure "species identification" (i.e., the association of metagenomic reads to existing species), because it can also give information about the evolutionary relationships between these query sequences and to known species. Approaches for phylogenetic placement have been developed that operate in two steps: first, an alignment is estimated for each query sequence to the alignment of the full-length sequences, and then that alignment is used to find the optimal location in the phylogenetic tree for the query sequence. Recent methods of this type include HMMALIGN+EPA, HMMALIGN+pplacer, and PaPaRa+EPA.We report on a study evaluating phylogenetic placement methods on biological and simulated data. This study shows that these methods have extremely good accuracy and computational tractability under conditions where the input contains a highly accurate alignment and tree for the full-length sequences, and the set of full-length sequences is sufficiently small and not too evolutionarily diverse; however, we also show that under other conditions accuracy declines and the computational requirements for memory and time exceed acceptable limits. We present SEPP, a general "boosting" technique to improve the accuracy and/or speed of phylogenetic placement techniques. The key algorithmic aspect of this booster is a dataset decomposition technique in SATé, a method that utilizes an iterative divide-and-conquer technique to co-estimate alignments and trees on large molecular sequence datasets. We show that SATé-boosting improves HMMALIGN+pplacer, placing short sequences more accurately when the set of input sequences has a large evolutionary diameter and produces placements of comparable accuracy in a fraction of the time for easier cases.

This paper proposes a novel approach for selecting and ordering a predetermined number of test cases from an existing test suite. Our approach forms an Integer Linear Programming problem using two different coverage-based criteria, and uses constraint relaxation to find many close-to-optimal solution points. These points are then combined to obtain a final solution using a voting mechanism. The selected subset of test cases is then prioritized using a greedy algorithm that maximizes minimum coverage in an iterative manner. The proposed approach has been empirically evaluated and the results show significant improvements over existing approaches for some cases and comparable results for the rest.

Phylogenetic trees inferred using commonly-used models of sequence evolution are unrooted, but the root position matters both for interpretation and downstream applications. This issue has been long recognized; however, whether the potential for discordance between the species tree and gene trees impacts methods of rooting a phylogenetic tree has not been extensively studied. In this paper, we introduce a new method of rooting a tree based on its branch length distribution; our method, which minimizes the variance of root to tip distances, is inspired by the traditional midpoint rerooting and is justified when deviations from the strict molecular clock are random. Like midpoint rerooting, the method can be implemented in a linear time algorithm. In extensive simulations that consider discordance between gene trees and the species tree, we show that the new method is more accurate than midpoint rerooting, but its relative accuracy compared to using outgroups to root gene trees depends on the size of the dataset and levels of deviations from the strict clock. We show high levels of error for all methods of rooting estimated gene trees due to factors that include effects of gene tree discordance, deviations from the clock, and gene tree estimation error. Our simulations, however, did not reveal significant differences between two equivalent methods for species tree estimation that use rooted and unrooted input, namely, STAR and NJst. Nevertheless, our results point to limitations of existing scalable rooting methods.},

	abstract = {Green plants (Viridiplantae) include around 450,000–500,000 species1,2 of great diversity and have important roles in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Here, as part of the One Thousand Plant Transcriptomes Initiative, we sequenced the vegetative transcriptomes of 1,124 species that span the diversity of plants in a broad sense (Archaeplastida), including green plants (Viridiplantae), glaucophytes (Glaucophyta) and red algae (Rhodophyta). Our analysis provides a robust phylogenomic framework for examining the evolution of green plants. Most inferred species relationships are well supported across multiple species tree and supermatrix analyses, but discordance among plastid and nuclear gene trees at a few important nodes highlights the complexity of plant genome evolution, including polyploidy, periods of rapid speciation, and extinction. Incomplete sorting of ancestral variation, polyploidization and massive expansions of gene families punctuate the evolutionary history of green plants. Notably, we find that large expansions of gene families preceded the origins of green plants, land plants and vascular plants, whereas whole-genome duplications are inferred to have occurred repeatedly throughout the evolution of flowering plants and ferns. The increasing availability of high-quality plant genome sequences and advances in functional genomics are enabling research on genome evolution across the green tree of life.},

	abstract = {Friday 12 December 2014 was a red-letter day in the history of ornithology. It saw simultaneous publication of some 27 papers in eight journals, based on a singularly far-reaching and exciting avian dataset: genomic data from 48 species of birds from 32 of the 35 recently proposed avian orders, chosen to span the evolutionary diversity of the class Aves (Zhang et al. 2014a, 2014b, 2014c; Jarvis et al. 2014a, 2014b). The body of work, representing output from more than 200 researchers working in 80 laboratories in 20 countries, reaches almost every corner of ornithology. A flagship paper (Jarvis et al. 2014a) stands on the shoulders of earlier and contemporary work (Hackett et al. 2008; Burleigh et al. 2015) to achieve a nearly complete understanding of relationships among the world’s major avian groups and the timing of the major events in their evolution. A listing of 20 of the papers associated with the dataset is available at http://www.sciencemag.org/content/346/6215/1308/ suppl/DC1 (verified 12 January 2015). One suite of papers, most of which comprise a one-page commentary as well as the full paper, examines the detailed molecular evolution that has made birds the feathered, toothless wonders that they are (Cui et al. 2014; Greenwold et al. 2014; Lovell et al. 2014; Meredith et al. 2014; Romanov et al. 2014; Weber et al. 2014a, 2014b; Wirthlin et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2014c). Another paper thoroughly examines neontological (from living birds) and palaeontological data to reassess the origins of birds (Xu et al. 2014). Next, a series of papers explores the same data to revolutionise other areas of ornithology: the conservation of endangered species (Callicrate et al. 2014; S. Li et al. 2014), the molecular basis of the responses of birds to long-term global climate change (C. Li et al. 2014), the evolution of sex chromosomes in birds (Zhou et al. 2014), and the neurobiology of song and vocal learning (Pfenning et al. 2014; Whitney et al. 2014). Notably, the entirety of the work published on 12 December 2014 rested on two foundations: museum collections of birds often made with no particular view to future uses of individual specimens (Kress 2014) and the need to invent new analytical methods to handle the volume of data involved (Aberer et al. 2014; B. Li et al. 2014; Mirarab et al. 2014a, 2014b, 2014c). Analyses for Jarvis et al. (2014a), conducted on nine supercomputers, took the equivalent of more than 400 years of single-processor computing. A genome is the full complement of DNA sequences in an organism. It represents the code for transcription and production of the proteins that build and define the organism’s phenotype. But the genome is not a homogeneous chunk of DNA evolving at one rate under one evolutionary force. It is more an evolutionary patchwork of many different kinds of DNA sequences. Some parts of the genome code for proteins and have intricate rates of evolution. Other portions do not code for proteins and evolve at other rates. Other non-coding DNA sequences are interspersed between genes, as well as within them, the latter being called introns. SomeDNA sequences move around the genome, inserting themselves into new positions within it. All contribute to a molecular ‘footprint’ of the evolutionary history of the organism carrying the DNA. The range of evolutionary forces that causeDNAsequences to evolve – that is, to change – includes natural selection and the random process of genetic drift among others. This spectrum ofDNAsequences, and their rates of evolution, can be drawn on to answer questions at different evolutionary depths from populations within a species down to commonalities between, say, animals and plants. The more kinds of DNA sequences one can look at, generally, the better are the chances of answering a question using information in DNA.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Placing new sequences onto reference phylogenies is increasingly used for analyzing environmental samples, especially microbiomes. Existing placement methods assume that query sequences have evolved under specific models directly on the reference phylogeny. For example, they assume single-gene data (e.g., 16S rRNA amplicons) have evolved under the GTR model on a gene tree. Placement, however, often has a more ambitious goal: extending a (genome-wide) species tree given data from individual genes without knowing the evolutionary model. Addressing this challenging problem requires new directions. Here, we introduce Deep-learning Enabled Phylogenetic Placement (DEPP), an algorithm that learns to extend species trees using single genes without prespecified models. In simulations and on real data, we show that DEPP can match the accuracy of model-based methods without any prior knowledge of the model. We also show that DEPP can update the multilocus microbial tree-of-life with single genes with high accuracy. We further demonstrate that DEPP can combine 16S and metagenomic data onto a single tree, enabling community structure analyses that take advantage of both sources of data.

Background: Determining the evolutionary relationships among the major lineages of extant birds has been one of the biggest challenges in systematic biology. To address this challenge, we assembled or collected the genomes of 48 avian species spanning most orders of birds, including all Neognathae and two of the five Palaeognathae orders. We used these genomes to construct a genome-scale avian phylogenetic tree and perform comparative genomic analyses.Findings: Here we present the datasets associated with the phylogenomic analyses, which include sequence alignment files consisting of nucleotides, amino acids, indels, and transposable elements, as well as tree files containing gene trees and species trees. Inferring an accurate phylogeny required generating: 1) A well annotated data set across species based on genome synteny; 2) Alignments with unaligned or incorrectly overaligned sequences filtered out; and 3) Diverse data sets, including genes and their inferred trees, indels, and transposable elements. Our total evidence nucleotide tree (TENT) data set (consisting of exons, introns, and UCEs) gave what we consider our most reliable species tree when using the concatenation-based ExaML algorithm or when using statistical binning with the coalescence-based MP-EST algorithm (which we refer to as MP-EST*). Other data sets, such as the coding sequence of some exons, revealed other properties of genome evolution, namely convergence.Conclusions: The Avian Phylogenomics Project is the largest vertebrate phylogenomics project to date that we are aware of. The sequence, alignment, and tree data are expected to accelerate analyses in phylogenomics and other related areas.},

Among Passerea, we infer the common ancestor of core landbirds to have been an apex predator and confirm independent gains of vocal learning. Among Columbea, we identify pigeons and flamingoes as belonging to sister clades. Even with whole genomes, some of the earliest branches in Neoaves proved challenging to resolve, which was best explained by massive protein-coding sequence convergence and high levels of incomplete lineage sorting that occurred during a rapid radiation after the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction event about 66 million years ago.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic trees define a metric space over their vertices, an observation that underlines distance-based phylogenetic inference. Several authors, including Layer and Rhodes (2017), have noted that we can embed leaves of a phylogenetic tree into high-dimensional Euclidean spaces in such a way that it minimizes the distortion of the tree distances. Jiang et al. (2021) use a deep learning approach to build a mapping from the space of sequences to the Euclidean space such that the mapped sequences accurately preserve the leaf distances on a given tree. Their tool, DEPP, uses this map to place a new query sequence onto the tree by first embedding it, an idea that was particularly promising for updating a species tree given data from a single gene despite the potential discordance of the gene tree and the species tree. In focusing on Euclidean spaces, these recent papers have ignored the strong theory that suggests hyperbolic spaces are more appropriate for embedding vertices of a tree. In this paper, we show that by moving to hyperbolic spaces and addressing challenges related to non-linearity and precision, we can reduce the distortion of distances for any given number of dimensions. The distortion of distances obtained using hyperbolic embeddings is lower than Euclidean embeddings with the same number of dimensions, both in training (backbone) and testing (query). The low-distortion distances of embeddings result in better topological accuracy in updating species trees using a single gene compared to its Euclidean counterpart. It also improves accuracy in placing queries for some datasets but not all.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic placement, used widely in ecological analyses, seeks to add a new species to an existing tree. A deep learning approach was previously proposed to estimate the distance between query and backbone species by building a map from gene sequences to a high-dimensional space that preserves species tree distances. They then use a distance-based placement method to place the queries on that species tree. In this paper, we examine the appropriate geometry for faithfully representing tree distances while embedding gene sequences. Theory predicts that hyperbolic spaces should provide a drastic reduction in distance distortion compared to the conventional Euclidean space. Nevertheless, hyperbolic embedding imposes its own unique challenges related to arithmetic operations, exponentially-growing functions, and limited bit precision, and we address these challenges. Our results confirm that hyperbolic embeddings have substantially lower distance errors than Euclidean space. However, these better-estimated distances do not always lead to better phylogenetic placement. We then show that the deep learning framework can be used not just to place on a backbone tree but to update it to obtain a fully resolved tree. With our hyperbolic embedding framework, species trees can be updated remarkably accurately with only a handful of genes.},

              Motivation
              Phylogenetic placement of a query sequence on a backbone tree is increasingly used across biomedical sciences to identify the content of a sample from its DNA content. The accuracy of such analyses depends on the density of the backbone tree, making it crucial that placement methods scale to very large trees. Moreover, a new paradigm has been recently proposed to place sequences on the species tree using single-gene data. The goal is to better characterize the samples and to enable combined analyses of marker-gene (e.g., 16S rRNA gene amplicon) and genome-wide data. The recent method DEPP enables performing such analyses using metric learning. However, metric learning is hampered by a need to compute and save a quadratically growing matrix of pairwise distances during training. Thus, the training phase of DEPP does not scale to more than roughly ten thousand backbone species, a problem that we faced when trying to use our recently released Greengenes2 (GG2) reference tree containing 331,270 species.
            
            
              Results
              This paper explores divide-and-conquer for training ensembles of DEPP models, culminating in a method called C-DEPP. While divide-and-conquer has been extensively used in phylogenetics, applying divide-and-conquer to data-hungry machine learning methods needs nuance. C-DEPP uses carefully crafted techniques to enable quasi-linear scaling while maintaining accuracy. C-DEPP enables placing twenty million 16S fragments on the GG2 reference tree in 41 hours of computation.

These new methods enable the investigation of sub-operational taxonomic units (sOTU) by removing erroneous sequences.

Although fragment insertion methods do exist, those methods have not been tested for sOTUs from high-throughput amplicon studies in insertions against a broad reference phylogeny. We benchmarked the SATé-enabled phylogenetic placement (SEPP) technique explicitly against 16S V4 sequence fragments and showed that it outperforms the conceptually problematic but often-used practice of reconstructing de novo phylogenies.

Nevertheless, Accurate Species TRee Algorithm (ASTRAL) species trees estimated using indels were generally similar to nt-based ASTRAL trees, albeit with lower support. However, the power of indel gene trees became clear when we combined them with nt gene trees, including a striking result for UCEs. The individual UCE indel and nt ASTRAL trees were incongruent with each other and with the intron ASTRAL trees; however, the combined indel+nt ASTRAL tree was much more congruent with the intronic trees.

	abstract = {Placing a new sequence onto an existing phylogenetic tree is increasingly used in downstream applications ranging from microbiome analyses to epidemic tracking. Most such applications deal with noisy data, incomplete references, and model misspecifications, all of which make the correct placement uncertain. While recent placement methods have increasingly enabled placement on ultra-large backbone trees with tens to hundreds of thousands of species, they have mostly ignored the issue of uncertainty. Here, we build on the recently developed distance-based phylogenetic placement methodology and show how the distribution of placements can be estimated per input sequence. We compare parametric and non-parametric sampling methods, showing that non-parametric bootstrapping is far more accurate in estimating uncertainty. Finally, we design and implement a linear algebraic implementation of bootstrapping that makes it faster, and we incorporate the computation of support values as a new feature in the APPLES software.},

	abstract = {Understanding how different species are evolutionarily related is key to addressing fundamental questions in biology and medicine. Scientists use species trees to describe these relationships, and they are typically inferred from genome sequences in modern research using methods that account for the mosaic of histories across the genome. However, while genome assemblies are easily available, species tree inference remains challenging for many researchers because the analysis pipeline demands considerable computing power and domain expertise. To address these barriers, we developed ROADIES—an automated, scalable, and user-friendly tool that infers species trees directly from genome assemblies. ROADIES enables researchers with broad expertise to infer accurate evolutionary trees with ease and efficiency, thus democratizing species tree inference. Current genome sequencing initiatives across a wide range of life forms offer significant potential to enhance our understanding of evolutionary relationships and support transformative biological and medical applications. Species trees play a central role in many of these applications; however, despite the widespread availability of genome assemblies, accurate inference of species trees remains challenging due to the limited automation, substantial domain expertise, and computational resources required by conventional methods. To address this limitation, we present ROADIES, a fully automated pipeline to infer species trees starting from raw genome assemblies. In contrast to the prominent approach, ROADIES incorporates a unique strategy of randomly sampling segments of the input genomes to generate gene trees. This eliminates the need for predefining a set of loci, limiting the analyses to a fixed number of genes, and performing the cumbersome gene annotation and/or whole genome alignment steps. ROADIES also eliminates the need to infer orthology by leveraging existing discordance-aware methods that allow multicopy genes. Using the genomic datasets from large-scale sequencing efforts across four diverse life forms (placental mammals, pomace flies, birds, and budding yeasts), we show that ROADIES infers species trees that are comparable in quality to the state-of-the-art studies but in a fraction of the time and effort, including on challenging datasets with rampant gene tree discordance and complex polyploidy. With its speed, accuracy, and automation, ROADIES has the potential to vastly simplify species tree inference, making it accessible to a broader range of scientists and applications.},

              Motivation
              The phylogenetic signal of structural variation informs a more comprehensive understanding of evolution. As (near-)complete genome assembly becomes more commonplace, the next methodological challenge for inferring genome rearrangement trees is the identification of syntenic blocks of orthologous sequences. In this article, we studied 94 reference quality genomes of primarily Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) isolates as a benchmark to evaluate these methods. The clonal nature of Mtb evolution, the manageable genome sizes, along with substantial levels of structural variation make this an ideal benchmarking dataset.
            
            
              Results
              We tested several methods for detecting homology and obtaining syntenic blocks and two methods for inferring phylogenies from them, then compared the resulting trees to the standard method’s tree, inferred from nucleotide substitutions. We found that, not only the choice of methods, but also their parameters can impact results, and that the tree inference method had less impact than the block determination method. Interestingly, a rearrangement tree based on blocks from the Cactus whole-genome aligner was fully compatible with the highly supported branches of the substitution-based tree, enabling the combination of the two into a high-resolution supertree. Overall, our results indicate that accurate trees can be inferred using genome rearrangements, but the choice of the methods for inferring homology requires care.

	abstract = {Phylogenetic identification of unknown sequences by placing them on a tree is routinely attempted in modern ecological studies. Such placements are often obtained from incomplete and noisy data, making it essential to augment the results with some notion of uncertainty. While the standard likelihood-based methods designed for placement naturally provide such measures of uncertainty, the newer and more scalable distance-based methods lack this crucial feature. Here, we adopt several parametric and nonparametric sampling methods for measuring the support of phylogenetic placements that have been obtained with the use of distances. Comparing the alternative strategies, we conclude that nonparametric bootstrapping is more accurate than the alternatives. We go on to show how bootstrapping can be performed efficiently using a linear algebraic formulation that makes it up to 30 times faster and implement this optimized version as part of the distance-based placement software APPLES. By examining a wide range of applications, we show that the relative accuracy of maximum likelihood (ML) support values as compared to distance-based methods depends on the application and the dataset. ML is advantageous for fragmentary queries, while distance-based support values are more accurate for full-length and multi-gene datasets. With the quantification of uncertainty, our work fills a crucial gap that prevents the broader adoption of distance-based placement tools.},

Sparse taxon sampling has previously been proposed to confound phylogenetic inference 5 , and captures only a fraction of the genomic diversity. Here we report a substantial step towards the dense representation of avian phylogenetic and molecular diversity, by analysing 363 genomes from 92.4\% of bird families—including 267 newly sequenced genomes produced for phase II of the Bird 10,000 Genomes (B10K) Project. We use this comparative genome dataset in combination with a pipeline that leverages a reference-free whole-genome alignment to identify orthologous regions in greater numbers than has previously been possible and to recognize genomic novelties in particular bird lineages. The densely sampled alignment provides a single-base-pair map of selection, has more than doubled the fraction of bases that are confidently predicted to be under conservation and reveals extensive patterns of weak selection in predominantly non-coding DNA. Our results demonstrate that increasing the diversity of genomes used in comparative studies can reveal more shared and lineage-specific variation, and improve the investigation of genomic characteristics. We anticipate that this genomic resource will offer new perspectives on evolutionary processes in cross-species comparative analyses and assist in efforts to conserve species.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Species tree estimation is challenging in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), which can make gene trees different from the species tree. Because ILS is expected to occur and the standard concatenation approach can return incorrect trees with high support in the presence of ILS, "coalescent-based" summary methods (which first estimate gene trees and then combine gene trees into a species tree) have been developed that have theoretical guarantees of robustness to arbitrarily high amounts of ILS. Some studies have suggested that summary methods should only be used on "c-genes" (i.e., recombination-free loci) that can be extremely short (sometimes fewer than 100 sites). However, gene trees estimated on short alignments can have high estimation error, and summary methods tend to have high error on short c-genes. To address this problem, Chifman and Kubatko introduced SVDquartets, a new coalescent-based method. SVDquartets takes multi-locus unlinked single-site data, infers the quartet trees for all subsets of four species, and then combines the set of quartet trees into a species tree using a quartet amalgamation heuristic. Yet, the relative accuracy of SVDquartets to leading coalescent-based methods has not been assessed.RESULTS:We compared SVDquartets to two leading coalescent-based methods (ASTRAL-2 and NJst), and to concatenation using maximum likelihood. We used a collection of simulated datasets, varying ILS levels, numbers of taxa, and number of sites per locus. Although SVDquartets was sometimes more accurate than ASTRAL-2 and NJst, most often the best results were obtained using ASTRAL-2, even on the shortest gene sequence alignments we explored (with only 10 sites per locus). Finally, concatenation was the most accurate of all methods under low ILS conditions.CONCLUSIONS:ASTRAL-2 generally had the best accuracy under higher ILS conditions, and concatenation had the best accuracy under the lowest ILS conditions. However, SVDquartets was competitive with the best methods under conditions with low ILS and small numbers of sites per locus. The good performance under many conditions of ASTRAL-2 in comparison to SVDquartets is surprising given the known vulnerability of ASTRAL-2 and similar methods to short gene sequences.},

It has been suggested, however, that the time constraints that can be imposed on regression testing by various software development processes can strongly affect the behavior of prioritization techniques. If this is correct, a better understanding of the effects of time constraints could lead to improved prioritization techniques and improved maintenance and testing processes. We therefore conducted a series of experiments to assess the effects of time constraints on the costs and benefits of prioritization techniques. Our first experiment manipulates time constraint levels and shows that time constraints do play a significant role in determining both the cost-effectiveness of prioritization and the relative cost-benefit trade-offs among techniques. Our second experiment replicates the first experiment, controlling for several threats to validity including numbers of faults present, and shows that the results generalize to this wider context. Our third experiment manipulates the number of faults present in programs to examine the effects of faultiness levels on prioritization and shows that faultiness level affects the relative cost-effectiveness of prioritization techniques. Taken together, these results have several implications for test engineers wishing to cost-effectively regression test their software systems.

	abstract = {Genetic tools are increasingly used to identify and discriminate between species. One key transition in this process was the recognition of the potential of the ca 658bp fragment of the organelle cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) as a barcode region, which revolutionized animal bioidentification and lead, among others, to the instigation of the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD), containing currently barcodes from {\textgreater}7.9 million specimens. Following this discovery, suggestions for other organellar regions and markers, and the primers with which to amplify them, have been continuously proposed. Most recently, the field has taken the leap from PCR‐based generation of DNA references into shotgun sequencing‐based “genome skimming” alternatives, with the ultimate goal of assembling organellar reference genomes. Unfortunately, in genome skimming approaches, much of the nuclear genome (as much as 99\% of the sequence data) is discarded, which is not only wasteful, but can also limit the power of discrimination at, or below, the species level. Here, we advocate that the full shotgun sequence data can be used to assign an identity (that we term for convenience its “DNA‐mark”) for both voucher and query samples, without requiring any computationally intensive pretreatment (e.g. assembly) of reads. We argue that if reference databases are populated with such “DNA‐marks,” it will enable future DNA‐based taxonomic identification to complement, or even replace PCR of barcodes with genome skimming, and we discuss how such methodology ultimately could enable identification to population, or even individual, level.},

	abstract = {Because biological processes can result in different loci having different evolutionary histories, species tree estimation requires multiple loci from across multiple genomes. While many processes can result in discord between gene trees and species trees, incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), modeled by the multi-species coalescent, is considered to be a dominant cause for gene tree heterogeneity. Coalescent-based methods have been developed to estimate species trees, many of which operate by combining estimated gene trees, and so are called "summary methods". Because summary methods are generally fast (and much faster than more complicated coalescent-based methods that co-estimate gene trees and species trees), they have become very popular techniques for estimating species trees from multiple loci. However, recent studies have established that summary methods can have reduced accuracy in the presence of gene tree estimation error, and also that many biological datasets have substantial gene tree estimation error, so that summary methods may not be highly accurate in biologically realistic conditions. Mirarab et al. (Science 2014) presented the "statistical binning" technique to improve gene tree estimation in multi-locus analyses, and showed that it improved the accuracy of MP-EST, one of the most popular coalescent-based summary methods. Statistical binning, which uses a simple heuristic to evaluate "combinability" and then uses the larger sets of genes to re-calculate gene trees, has good empirical performance, but using statistical binning within a phylogenomic pipeline does not have the desirable property of being statistically consistent. We show that weighting the re-calculated gene trees by the bin sizes makes statistical binning statistically consistent under the multispecies coalescent, and maintains the good empirical performance. Thus, "weighted statistical binning" enables highly accurate genome-scale species tree estimation, and is also statistically consistent under the multi-species coalescent model.

	abstract = {Species tree estimation from multiple markers is complicated by the fact that gene trees can differ from each other (and from the true species tree) due to several biological processes, one of which is gene duplication and loss. Local search heuristics for two NP-hard optimization problems - minimize gene duplications (MGD) and minimize gene duplications and losses (MGDL) - are popular techniques for estimating species trees in the presence of gene duplication and loss. In this paper, we present an alternative approach to solving MGD and MGDL from rooted gene trees. First, we characterize each tree in terms of its "subtree-bipartitions" (a concept we introduce). Then we show that the MGD species tree is defined by a maximum weight clique in a vertex-weighted graph that can be computed from the subtree-bipartitions of the input gene trees, and the MGDL species tree is defined by a minimum weight clique in a similarly constructed graph. We also show that these optimal cliques can be found in polynomial time in the number of vertices of the graph using a dynamic programming algorithm (similar to that of Hallett and Lagergren(1)), because of the special structure of the graphs. Finally, we show that a constrained version of these problems, where the subtree-bipartitions of the species tree are drawn from the subtree-bipartitions of the input gene trees, can be solved in time that is polynomial in the number of gene trees and taxa. We have implemented our dynamic programming algorithm in a publicly available software tool, available at http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/phylo/software/dynadup/.},

	abstract = {Placing a new species on an existing phylogeny has increasing relevance to several applications. Placement can be used to update phylogenies in a scalable fashion and can help identify unknown query samples using (meta-)barcoding, skimming, or metagenomic data. Maximum likelihood (ML) methods of phylogenetic placement exist, but these methods are not scalable to reference trees with many thousands of leaves, limiting their ability to enjoy benefits of dense taxon sampling in modern reference libraries. They also rely on assembled sequences for the reference set and aligned sequences for the query. Thus, ML methods cannot analyze data sets where the reference consists of unassembled reads, a scenario relevant to emerging applications of genome skimming for sample identification. We introduce APPLES, a distance-based method for phylogenetic placement. Compared to ML, APPLES is an order of magnitude faster and more memory efficient, and unlike ML, it is able to place on large backbone trees (tested for up to 200,000 leaves). We show that using dense references improves accuracy substantially so that APPLES on dense trees is more accurate than ML on sparser trees, where it can run. Finally, APPLES can accurately identify samples without assembled reference or aligned queries using kmer-based distances, a scenario that ML cannot handle.

	abstract = {While aligning sequences has been the dominant approach for determining homology prior to phylogenetic inference, alignment-free methods have much appeal in terms of simplifying the process of inference, especially when analyzing genome-wide data. Furthermore, alignment-free methods present the only option for some emerging forms of data, such as genome skims, which cannot be assembled. Despite the appeal, alignment-free methods have not been competitive with alignment-based methods in terms of accuracy. One limitation of alignment-free methods is that they typically rely on simplified models of sequence evolution such as Jukes-Cantor. It is possible to compute pairwise distances under more complex models by computing frequencies of base substitutions provided that these quantities can be estimated in the alignment-free setting. A particular limitation is that for many forms of genomewide data, which arguably present the best use case for alignment-free methods, the strand of DNA sequences is unknown. Under such conditions, the so-called no-strand bias models are the most complex models that can be used. Here, we show how to calculate distances under a no-strain bias restriction of the General Time Reversible (GTR) model called TK4 without relying on alignments. The method relies on replacing letters in the input sequences, and subsequent computation of Jaccard indices between k-mer sets. For the method to work on large genomes, we also need to compute the number of k-mer mismatches after replacement due to random chance as opposed to homology. We show in simulation that these alignment-free distances can be highly accurate when genomes evolve under the assumed models, and we examine the effectiveness of the method on real genomic data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Clustering homologous sequences based on their similarity is a problem that appears in many bioinformatics applications. The fact that sequences cluster is ultimately the result of their phylogenetic relationships. Despite this observation and the natural ways in which a tree can define clusters, most applications of sequence clustering do not use a phylogenetic tree and instead operate on pairwise sequence distances. Due to advances in large-scale phylogenetic inference, we argue that tree-based clustering is under-utilized. We define a family of optimization problems that, given an arbitrary tree, return the minimum number of clusters such that all clusters adhere to constraints on their heterogeneity. We study three specific constraints, limiting (1) the diameter of each cluster, (2) the sum of its branch lengths, or (3) chains of pairwise distances. These three problems can be solved in time that increases linearly with the size of the tree, and for two of the three criteria, the algorithms have been known in the theoretical computer scientist literature. We implement these algorithms in a tool called TreeCluster, which we test on three applications: OTU clustering for microbiome data, HIV transmission clustering, and divide-and-conquer multiple sequence alignment. We show that, by using tree-based distances, TreeCluster generates more internally consistent clusters than alternatives and improves the effectiveness of downstream applications.

	abstract = {The abundant discordance between evolutionary relationships across the genome has rekindled interest in ways of comparing and averaging trees on a shared leaf set. However, most attempts at reconciling trees have focused on tree topology, producing metrics for comparing topologies and methods for computing median tree topologies. Using branch lengths, however, has been more elusive, due to several challenges. Species tree branch lengths can be measured in many units, often different from gene trees. Moreover, rates of evolution change across the genome, the species tree, and specific branches of gene trees. These factors compound the stochasticity of coalescence times. Thus, branch lengths are highly heterogeneous across both the genome and the tree. For many downstream applications in phylogenomic analyses, branch lengths are as important as the topology, and yet, existing tools to compare and combine weighted trees are limited. In this paper, we make progress on the question of mapping one tree to another, incorporating both topology and branch length. We define a series of computational problems to formalize finding the best transformation of one tree to another while maintaining its topology and other constraints. We show that all these problems can be solved in quadratic time and memory using a linear algebraic formulation coupled with dynamic programming preprocessing. Our formulations lead to convex optimization problems, with efficient and theoretically optimal solutions. While many applications can be imagined for this framework, we apply it to measure species tree branch lengths in the unit of the expected number of substitutions per site while allowing divergence from ultrametricity across the tree. In these applications, our method matches or surpasses other methods designed directly for solving those problems. Thus, our approach provides a versatile toolkit that finds applications in similar evolutionary questions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

One way to obtain a species tree is to find one that maximizes some measure of similarity to a set of gene trees. The number of shared quartets between a potential species tree and gene trees provides a statistically justifiable score; if maximized properly, it could result in a statistically consistent estimator of the species tree under several statistical models of discordance. However, finding the median quartet score tree, one that maximizes this score, is NP-Hard, motivating several existing heuristic algorithms. These heuristics do not follow the hill-climbing paradigm used extensively in phylogenetics. In this paper, we make theoretical contributions that enable an efficient hill-climbing approach. Specifically, we show that a subtree of size m can be placed optimally on a tree of size n in quasi-linear time with respect to n and (almost) independently of m. This result enables us to perform subtree prune and regraft (SPR) rearrangements as part of a hill-climbing search.

To close this gap, we explore the problem of matching a query tree to a reference tree by assigning new branch lengths to the query tree. We formulate this objective as a least-squares optimization problem defined on the set of all pairwise distances. We prove that the problem is convex and thus can be solved optimally using standard tools.
