See my [gitub page](https://github.com/smirarab) to see all my publicly available software programs. 

* [ASTRAL](https://github.com/smirarab/ASTRAL): Species tree estimation from unrooted gene trees using a quartet-based approach (consistent under multi-species coalescent process and hence useful for handling gene tree incongruence caused by ILS). 

* [PASTA](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~phylo/software/pasta/): Software for alignment and tree estimation on very large datasets (thousands to hundreds of thousands of sequences). This is a new version of SATé, and the code is heavily based on the SATé code. 

* [SEPP](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~phylo/software/sepp/submission/): Software for fast phylogenetic placement based on SATe decomposition - useful for metagenomic analyses

* [TIPP](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~phylo/software/sepp/tipp-submission): Taxonomic identification and taxonomic profiling of metagenomic samples (uses SEPP). 

* [FastSP](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~smirarab/fastsp): Fast and Memory efficient software for comparison of multiple sequence alignments (computes SP-FN and TC scores) 

* I also work on and contribute code to [SATé](http://phylo.bio.ku.edu/software/sate/sate.html).
